<p>The tall young lady who arrived fifteen minutes before the
Freddy Tunbridges' dinner-hour, was not taken into the great
empty drawing-room, but, as though she were not to be of the party
expected that night, straight upstairs she went behind the footman,
and then up more stairs behind a maid. The smart, white-capped
domestic paused, and her floating muslin streamers cut
short their a&euml;rial gyrations subsiding against her straight black
back as she knocked at the night-nursery door. It was opened by
a middle-aged head nurse of impressive demeanour. She stood
there an instant eyeing the intruder with the kind of overbearing
hauteur that in these days does duty as the peculiar hall-mark
of the upper servant, being seldom encountered in England among
even the older generation of the so-called governing class.</p>

<p>'It's too late to see the baby, miss. He's asleep.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know; but the others are expecting me, aren't they?'</p>

<p>Question hardly necessary, perhaps, with the air full of cries
from beyond the screen: 'Yes, yes.' 'We're waiting!' 'Mummy
promised'&mdash;cut short by the nurse saying sharply, 'Not so
much noise, Miss Sara.' But the presiding genius of the Tunbridge
nursery opened the door a little wider and stood aside.
Handsome compensation for her studied coldness was offered in
the shrill shrieks of joy with which a little girl and a very small boy
celebrated the lady's entrance. She, for her part, joined the
austere nurse in saying, 'Sh! sh!' and in simulating consternation
at the spectacle behind the screen, Miss Sara jumping up and
down in the middle of her bed with wild brown hair swirling madly
about a laughing but mutinous face. The visitor, hurrying forward,
received the impetuous little girl in her arms, while the nurse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>described her own sentiments of horror and detestation of such
performances, and hinted vaguely at Retribution that might with
safety be looked for no later than the morrow. Nobody listened.
Miss Levering nodded smiling across Sara's nightgowned figure
to the little boy hanging over the side of the neighbouring cot.
But he kept remonstrating, 'You always go to her first.'</p>

<p>The lady drew a flat, shiny wooden box out of the inside pocket
of her cloak. The little girl seized it rapturously.</p>

<p>'Oh, did you only bring Sara's bock?' wailed the smaller Tunbridge.
'I told you expecially we wanted <i>two</i> bocks.'</p>

<p>'I've got two pockets and I've got two bocks. Let me give him
his, Sara darling.'</p>

<p>But 'Sara darling' dropped her own 'bock' the better to cling
round the neck of the giver.</p>

<p>Naturally Master Cecil sounded the horn of indignation.</p>

<p>'Hush!' commanded his sister. 'Don't you know his little
lordship never did that?' And to emphasize this satirical appeal
to a higher standard of manners, Sara loosened her tight-locked
arms an instant; but still holding to the visitor with one hand, she
picked up the pillow and deftly hurled it at the neighbouring cot,
extinguishing the little boy. Through the general recriminations
that ensued, the culprit cried with shrill rapture, 'Lady Gladys
never pillow-fought! Lady Gladys was a little lady and never
did <i>any</i>thing!' The merry eyes shamelessly invited Miss Levering
to mock at Dampney's former charges. But the visitor detached
herself from Miss Sara, and wishing apparently to ingratiate
herself with the offended majesty of the nurse, Miss Levering
said gravely over her shoulder, 'Now, lie down, Sara, and be a
good girl.' Sara's reply to that was to (what she called) 'diddle
up and down' on her knees and emit shrill squeals of some pleasurable
emotion not defined. This, too, in spite of the fact that
Dampney had picked up the pillow and was advancing upon Miss
Sara with an expression calculated to shake the stoutest heart.
It obviously shook the visitor's. 'Listen, Sara! If you don't be
quiet and let nurse cover you up, she won't want me to stay.'
Miss Levering actually got up off the little boy's bed, and stood as
though ready to carry the obnoxious suggestion into instant effect.</p>

<p>Sara darted under the bedclothes like a rabbit into its burrow.
The rigid woman, without words, restored the tousled pillow to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>head of the bed, extracted Miss Sara from her hiding-place with
one hand, smoothed out the rebellious legs with the other, covered
the child firmly over, and tucked the bedclothes in.</p>

<p>'What's the use of all that? Mother always does it over again.'</p>

<p>'You know very well she's been and done it once already.'</p>

<p>'She's coming again if father doesn't need her.'</p>

<p>'There's a whole big dinner-party needing her, so you needn't
think she can come twice to say good-night to a Jumping-Jack
like you.'</p>

<p>'You ought to say a Jumping-Jill,' amended Sara.</p>

<p>During this interchange Master Cecil was complaining to the
visitor&mdash;</p>

<p>'I can't see you with that thing all round your head.'</p>

<p>'Yes, take it off!' his sister agreed; and when the lady had
unwound her lace scarf&mdash;'Now the coat! And you have to sit
on my bed this time. It's my turn.'</p>

<p>As the visitor divested herself of the long ermine-lined garment,
'Oh, you <i>are</i> pretty to-night!' observed the gallant young gentleman
over the way, seeming not to have heard that these effects
don't appeal to little boys.</p>

<p>Sara silently craned her neck. Even the high and mighty
Mrs. Dampney, in the surreptitious way of the superior servant,
without seeming to look, was covertly taking in the vision that the
cloak had hitherto obscured. The little girl followed with critical
eyes the movement of the tall figure, the graceful fall of the clinging
black lace gown embroidered in yellow irises, the easy bend of the
small waist in its jewelled belt of yellow. The growing approval
in the little face culminated in an ecstatic 'Oh-h-h! let me see
what's on your neck! That's new, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;very old.'</p>

<p>'I didn't know there were yellow diamonds,' said Sara.</p>

<p>'There are; but these are sapphires.'</p>

<p>'And the little stones round?'</p>

<p>'Yes, they're diamonds.'</p>

<p>'The hanging-down thing is <i>such</i> a pretty shape!'</p>

<p>'Yes, the fleur-de-lys is a pretty shape. It's the flower of France,
you know&mdash;just as the thistle is the&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'There, now!' A penetrating whisper came from the other
bed. 'She's <i>gone</i>.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>'It's you who've been keeping her here, you know.' Miss
Levering bent her neat, dark head over the little girl, and the
gleaming jewels swung forward.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Cecil, in a tone of grandfatherly disgust; 'yelling
like a wild Indian.'</p>

<p>'Well, you <i>cried</i>,' said his sister&mdash;'just because a feather pillow
hit you.' Her eye never once left the glittering gaud.</p>

<p>'You see, Cecil is younger than you,' Miss Levering reminded
her.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Sara, with conscious superiority&mdash;'a whole year
and eight months. But even when I was young <i>I</i> had sense.'</p>

<p>Miss Levering laughed. 'You're a horrid little Pharisee&mdash;and
as wild as a young colt.' Contrary to received canons, the
visitor seemed to find something reassuring in the latter reflection,
for she kissed the small, self-righteous face.</p>

<p>'You just ought to have seen Sara this morning!' Cecil chuckled,
with a generous admiration in family achievements. 'We waked
up early, and Sara said, "Let's go mountaineering." So we did.
All over the rocks and presserpittses.' He waved his hand comprehensively
at the rugged scenery of the night-nursery.</p>

<p>'Of course we had to pile up the chairs and things,' his sister
explained.</p>

<p>'And the coal scuttle.'</p>

<p>'And we made snow mountains out of the pillows. When the
chairs wobbled, the coal and the pillows kept falling about; it was
quite a real avalanche,' Sara said conversationally.</p>

<p>'I should think so,' agreed the guest.</p>

<p>'Yes; and it was glorious when Sara excaped to the top of the
wardrobe.'</p>

<p>'To the w&mdash;&mdash;' Miss Levering gasped.</p>

<p>'Yes. We were having the most perfectly fascinating time&mdash;&mdash;'
Sara took up the tale.</p>

<p>But Cecil suddenly sat bolt upright, his little face quite pink
with excitement at recollection of these Alpine exploits.</p>

<p>'Yes, Sara had come down off the wardrobe&mdash;she'd been
sitting on the carved piece&mdash;she says that's the Schreckhorn!&mdash;but
she'd come down off it, and we was just jumping about all
those mountains like two shamrocks&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Like what?'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>'&mdash;when <i>she</i> came in.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' agreed Sara. 'Just when we're happiest <i>she</i> always
comes interfiddling.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Sara mine, I rather like you!' said Miss Levering, laying
her laughing face against the tousled hair.</p>

<p>'Now! Now!' cried Cecil, suddenly beating with his two fists
on the counterpane as though he'd seen as much valuable time
wasted as he felt it incumbent upon him to tolerate. 'Go on where
you left off.'</p>

<p>'No, it's <i>my</i> visit this time.' Sara held fast to her friend. 'It's
for me to say what we're going to talk about.'</p>

<p>'It's got to be alligators!' said Cecil, waving his arms.</p>

<p>'It <i>shan't</i> be alligators! I want to know more about Doris.'</p>

<p>'Doris!' Cecil's tone implied that the human intelligence could
no lower sink.</p>

<p>'Yes. I expect you like her better than you do us.'</p>

<p>'Don't you think I ought to like my niece best?'</p>

<p>'No'&mdash;from Cecil.</p>

<p>'You said we belonged to you, too,' observed Miss Sara.</p>

<p>'Of course.'</p>

<p>'And all aunts,' she pursued, 'don't like their nieces so <i>dreadfully</i>.'</p>

<p>'Don't they?' inquired Miss Levering, with an elaborate air of
innocence.</p>

<p>'You didn't say how-do-you-do to me,' said Cecil, with the air
of one who makes a useful discovery.</p>

<p>'<i>What?</i>'</p>

<p>'Why, she went to you the minute I threw the pillow.'</p>

<p>'That was just to save me from being dead. It isn't a proper
how-do-you-do when she doesn't hug you.'</p>

<p>'I'll hug you when I go.'</p>

<p>But a better plan than that occurred to Cecil. He flung down
the covers with the decision of one called to set about some urgent
business.</p>

<p>'Cecil! I simply won't have you catching cold!'</p>

<p>Before the words were out of Miss Levering's mouth he had
tumbled out of bed and leapt into her lap. He clasped his arms
round her neck with an air of rapturous devotion, but what he
said was&mdash;</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>'Go on 'bout the alligator.'</p>

<p>'No, no. Go 'way!' protested Sara, pushing him with hands
and feet.</p>

<p>'Sh! You really will have nurse back!'</p>

<p>That horrid thought coerced the prudent Sara to endurance of
the interloping brother. And now of his own accord Cecil had
taken his arms from round his friend's neck.</p>

<p>'That's horrid!' he said. 'I don't like that hard thing. Take
it off.'</p>

<p>'Let me.' Sara sat up with alacrity. 'Let me.'</p>

<p>But Miss Levering undid the sapphire necklace herself. 'If
you'll be very careful, Sara, I'll let you hold it.' It was as if she
well knew the deft little hands she had delivered the ornament to,
and knew equally well that in her present mood, absorption in the
beauty of it would keep the woman-child still.</p>

<p>'There, that's better!' Cecil replaced his arms firmly where
the necklace had been.</p>

<p>Miss Levering pulled up her long cloak from the bottom of
the bed and wrapped the little boy in the warm lining. The
comfort of the arrangement was so great, and it implied so little
necessity for 'hanging on,' that Cecil loosed his arms and lay curled
up against his friend.</p>

<p>She held him close, adapting her lithe slimness to the easy
supporting and enfolding of the childish figure. The little girl
was absorbed in the necklace after her strenuous hour; the boy,
content for a moment, having gained his point, just to lie at his
ease; the woman rested her cheek on his ruffled hair and looked
straight before her.</p>

<p>As she sat there holding him, something came into her face,
guiltless though it was of any traceable change, without the verifiable
movement of a muscle, something none the less that would
have minded the beholder uneasily to search the eyes for tears,
and, finding no tears there, to feel no greater sense of reassurance.</p>

<p>So motionless she sat that presently the child turned up his rosy
face, and seeing the brooding look, it was plain he had the sense
of being somehow left behind. He put up his hand to her cheek,
and rubbed it softly with his own.</p>

<p>'I don't like you like that. Tell me about&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Like what?' said the lady.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>'Like&mdash;I don't know.' Then, with a sudden inspiration,
'Uncle Ronald says you're like the Sphinx. Who are they?'</p>

<p>'Who are who?'</p>

<p>'Why, the Sfinks. Have they got a boy? Is the little Sfink
as old as me? Oh, you only laugh, just like Uncle Ronald. He
asked us why we liked you, and we told him.'</p>

<p>'You've never told me.'</p>

<p>'Oh, didn't we? Well, it's because you aren't beady.'</p>

<p>'Beady?'</p>

<p>'Yes. We hate all beady ladies, don't we, Sara?'</p>

<p>'Yes; but it's my turn.' However, she said it half-heartedly
as she stopped drawing the shining jewels lightly through her slim
fingers, and began gently to swing the fleur-de-lys back and forth
like a pendulum that glanced bewitchingly in the light.</p>

<p>Miss Levering knew that the next phase would be to try it on,
but for the moment Sara had still half an ear for general conversation.</p>

<p>'We hate them to have hard things on their shoulders!' Cecil
explained.</p>

<p>'On their shoulders?' Miss Levering asked.</p>

<p>'Here, just in the way of our heads.'</p>

<p>'Yes, bead-trimming on their dresses,' explained the little girl.</p>

<p>'Hard stuff that scratches when they hold you tight.' Cecil
cuddled his impudent round face luxuriously on the soft lace-covered
shoulder of the visitor, and laughed up in her face.</p>

<p>'Aunts are very beady,' said Sara, absent-mindedly, as she tried
the effect of the glitter against her night-gown.</p>

<p>'Grandmothers are worse,' amended Cecil. 'They're beady
and bu-gly, too.'</p>

<p>'What's bewgly?'</p>

<p>'Well, it's what my grandmother called them when I pulled
some of them off. Not proper bugles, you know, what you "too!
too! too!" make music with when you're fighting the enemy.
My grandmother thinks bugles are little shiny black things only
about that long'&mdash;he measured less than an inch on his minute
<a name="Page_7t" id="Page_7t"></a><a href="#Page_7tn">forefinger</a>&mdash;'with long holes through so they can sew them on
their clothes.'</p>

<p>'On their caps, too,' said Sara; 'only they're usurally white
when they're on caps.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>'Here's your mother coming! Now, what will she say to you,
Cecil?'</p>

<p>They turned their eyes to the door, strangely unwelcoming for
Laura Tunbridge's children, and their young faces betrayed no
surprise when the very different figure of Nurse Dampney emerged
from behind the tall chintz screen that protected the cots from any
draught through the opening door. Cecil, with an action of settled
despair, turned from the spectacle, and buried his face for
one last moment of comfort in Vida Levering's shoulder; while
Sara, with a baleful glance, muttered&mdash;</p>

<p>'I knew it was that old interfiddler.'</p>

<p>'Now, Master Cecil&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, nurse.' Miss Levering carried him back to his cot.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Tunbridge has sent up, miss, to know if you've come.
They're waiting dinner.'</p>

<p>'Not really! Is it a quarter past already?'</p>

<p>'More like twenty minutes, miss.'</p>

<p>The lady caught up her necklace, cut short her good-byes, and
fled downstairs, clasping the shining thing round her neck as she
went&mdash;a swaying figure in soft flying draperies and gleaming,
upraised arms.</p>

<p>She entered the drawing-room with a quiet deliberation greater
even than common. It was the effect that haste and contrition
frequently wrought in her&mdash;one of the things that made folk call
her 'too self-contained,' even 'a trifle supercilious.'</p>

<p>But when other young women, recognizing some not easily
definable charm in this new-comer into London life, tried to copy
the effect alluded to, it was found to be less imitable than it looked.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>There were already a dozen or so persons in the gold-and-white
drawing-room, yet the moment Vida Levering entered, she
knew from the questing glance Mrs. Freddy sent past her children's
visitor, that even now the party was not complete.</p>

<p>Other eyes turned that way as the servant announced 'Miss
Levering.' It is seldom that in this particular stratum of London
life anything so uncontrolled and uncontrollable as a 'sensation'
is permitted to chequer the even distribution of subdued good
humour that reigns so modestly in the drawing-rooms of the
Tunbridge world. If any one is so ill-advised as to bring to these
gatherings anything resembling a sensation, even if it is of the less
challengeable sort of striking personal beauty, the general aim of
the company is to pretend either that they see nothing unusual in
the conjunction, or that they, for their part, are impervious to such
impacts. Vida Levering's beauty was not strictly of the <i>&eacute;clatant</i>
type. If it did&mdash;as could not be denied&mdash;arrest the eye, its
refusal to let <a name="Page_9t" id="Page_9t"></a><a href="#Page_9tn">attention</a> go was mitigated by something in the quietness,
the disarming softness, with which the hold was maintained.
Men making her acquaintance frequently went through four distinct
phases in their feeling about her. The first was the common
natural one, the instant stirring of the pulses that beauty of any
sort produces in persons having the eye that sees. The second
stage was a rousing of the instinct to be 'on guard,' which feminine
beauty not infrequently breeds in the breasts of men. Not on
guard so much against the thing itself, or even against ready submission
to it, but against allowing onlookers to be witness of such
submission. Even the very young man knows either by experience
or hearsay, that women have concentrated upon their faculty for
turning this particular weapon to account, all the skill they would
have divided among other resources had there been others. Yet
the charm is something too delicious even to desire to escape from&mdash;the
impulse centres in a determination to <i>seem</i> untouched,
immune.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The third stage in this declension from pleasure through caution
to reassurance is induced by something so gentle, so unemphatic
in the Vida Levering aspect, so much what the man thinks 'feminine,'
that even the wariest male is reassured. He comes to be
almost as easy before this particular type of allurement as he would
be with the frankly plain 'good sort'; only there is all about him
the exquisite aroma of a subtle charm which he may almost persuade
himself that he alone perceives, since this softly gracious
creature seems so little to insist upon it&mdash;seems, indeed, to be
herself unaware of its presence. Whereupon the man conceives
a new idea of his own perspicacity in detecting a thing at once so
agreeable and so little advertised. He may, with a woman of this
kind, go long upon the third 'tack'&mdash;may, indeed, never know
it was she who gently 'shunted' him, still unenlightened, and left
him side-tracked, but cherishing to the end of time the soothing
conviction that he 'might an' if he would.' To the more robust
order of man will come a day of awakening, when he rubs his eyes
and retreats hurriedly with a sense of good faith injured&mdash;nay,
of hopes positively betrayed. If she were '<i>that</i> sort,' why not hang
out some signal? It wasn't playing fair.</p>

<p>And so without anything so crude as a sensation, but with a
retinue of covert looks following in her train, she made her way to
the young hostess, and was there joined by two men and a middle-aged
woman, who plainly had been a beauty, and though 'gone
to fat,' as the vulgar say, had yet kept her complexion. With an
air of genial authority, the pink-cheeked Lady John Ulland proceeded
to appropriate the new-comer in the midst of a general hum
of conversation, whose key to the sensitive ear had become a little
heightened since the last arrival. The women grew more insistently
vivacious in proportion as the men's minds seemed to wander
from matters they had discussed contentedly enough before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Freddy Tunbridge was a very popular person. It was
agreed that nobody willingly missed one of her parties. There
were those who said this was not so much because of her and Mr.
Freddy, though they were eminently likeable people; not merely
because you met 'everybody' there, and not even because of the
excellence of their dinners. Notoriously this last fact fails to
appeal very powerfully to the majority of women, and it is they,
not men, who make the social reputation of the hostess. There
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>was in this particular case a theory, held even by those who did
not care especially about Mrs. Freddy, that hers was an 'amusing,'
above all, perhaps, a 'becoming,' house. People had a pleasant
consciousness of looking uncommon well in her pretty drawing-room.
Others said it wasn't the room, it was the lighting, which
certainly was most discerningly done&mdash;not dim, and yet so far
from glaring that quite plain people enjoyed there a brief unwonted
hour of good looks. Only a limited amount of electricity was used,
and that little was carefully masked and modulated, while the two
great chandeliers each of them held aloft a very forest of wax
candles. It was known, too, that the spell was in no danger of
being rudely broken. The same tender but festive radiance would
bathe the hospitable board of the great oak dining-room below.</p>

<p>And why were they not processing thither?</p>

<p>'Is it my sister who is late?' Miss Levering asked, turning her
slim neck in that deliberate way of hers to look about the room.</p>

<p>'No; your sister is over there, talking to&mdash;&mdash; Oh&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;'
Mrs. Freddy, having looked round to refresh her memory, was
fain to slur over the fact that Mrs. Fox-Moore was in the corner
by the pierced screen, not talking to any one, but, on the contrary,
staring dark-visaged, gloomy, sibylline, at a leaflet advertising a
charity concert, a document conspicuously left by Mrs. Freddy on
a little table. On her way to rescue Mrs. Fox-Moore from her
desert island of utter loneliness, Mrs. Freddy saw Sir William
Haycroft, the newly-made Cabinet Minister, rather pointedly
making his escape from a tall, keen-looking, handsome woman
wearing eye-glasses and iron-grey hair dressed commandingly.</p>

<p>Without a qualm Mrs. Freddy abandoned Mrs. Fox-Moore to
prolonged exile, in order to soothe the ruffled minister.</p>

<p>'I think,' she said, pausing in front of the great man and delicately
offering him an opportunity to make any predilection
known&mdash;'I think you know every one here.'</p>

<p>Haycroft muttered in his beard&mdash;but his eyes had lit upon the
new face.</p>

<p>'Who's that?' he said; but his tone added, 'Not that it matters.'</p>

<p>'You don't know her? Well, that's a proof of how you've
neglected your friends since the new Government came in. But
you really mean it&mdash;that nobody has introduced you to Miss
Levering yet? What <i>is</i> Freddy thinking about!'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>'Dinner!' replied a voice at her elbow with characteristic
laconism, and Freddy Tunbridge pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>'Oh, give them five minutes more,' said his wife, indulgently.</p>

<p>'That's not a daughter of old Sir Hervey?' pursued the other
man, his eyes still on the young woman talking to Lady John and
the foreign ambassador.</p>

<p>'Yes; go on,' said Mrs. Freddy, with as cloudless a brow as
though she had no need to manufacture conversation while the
dinner was being kept waiting. 'Go on! They <i>all</i> do it.'</p>

<p>'Do what?' demanded the great man, suspiciously.</p>

<p>'"Why haven't they seen her before" comes next. Then the
next time you and I meet in the country or find ourselves alone
in a crush, you'll be saying, "What's her story? Why hasn't a
woman like that married?" They all do! You don't believe
me? Just wait! Freddy shall take you over, and&mdash;&mdash;' Was
Mrs. Freddy beaming at the prospective success of her new friend,
or was her vanity flattered by reflecting upon her own perspicacity?
Unavoidable as it was in a way that Mrs. Graham Townley should
be taken down to dinner by the new minister&mdash;nevertheless the
antidote had been cleverly provided for. 'Freddy dear&mdash;why, I
thought he was&mdash;&mdash; Oh, there he is!' Seeing her hungry husband
safely anchored in front of the iris gown, instantly she
abandoned the idea of disturbing him. 'After all,' she said, turning
again to Haycroft, who had stood the image of stolid unimpressionableness&mdash;'after
all, Freddy's right. Since she's going
to sit beside you at dinner, it's a good reason for not making you
known to each other before. Or perhaps you never experience
that awful feeling of being talked out by the time you go down,
and not having a single thing left&mdash;&mdash;' She saw that the great
man was not going to vouchsafe any contribution to her small
attempt to keep the ball rolling; so without giving him the chance
to mark her failure by a silence, however brief, she chattered on.
'Though with Vida you're not likely to find yourself in that predicament.
Is he, Ronald?' With the instinct of the well-trained
female to draw into her circle any odd man hovering about on the
periphery, Mrs. Freddy appealed to her brother-in-law. Lord
Borrodaile turned in her direction his long sallow face&mdash;a face
that would have been saturnine but for its touch of whimsicality
and a singularly charming smile. 'My brother-in-law will bear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>me out,' Mrs. Freddy went on, quite as though breaking off a
heated argument.</p>

<p>Lord Borrodaile sauntered up and offered a long thin hand to
Haycroft ('the fella who's bringing the country to the dogs,' as
Mrs. Freddy knew right well was his conviction).</p>

<p>Steering wide of politics, 'I gather,' he said, with his air of
amiable boredom, 'that you were discussing what used in the days
of my youth to be called a lady's "conversational powers."'</p>

<p>'I forbid you to apply such deadly phrases to my friend,' Mrs.
Freddy denounced him. '<i>Your</i> friend, too!'</p>

<p>'I'll prove my title to the distinction by proclaiming that she has
the subtlest art a woman can possess.'</p>

<p>'Ah, <i>that's</i> more like it!' said Mrs. Freddy, gaily. 'What is
the subtlest art?'</p>

<p>'The art of being silent without being dull.'</p>

<p>If there was any sting in this for the lady nearest him, she gave
no sign of making the personal application.</p>

<p>'Now I expressly forbid your encouraging Vida in silence!
Most men like to be amused. You know perfectly well <i>you</i> do!'</p>

<p>'Ah, yes,' he said languidly, catching Haycroft's eye and almost
making terms with him upon a common ground of masculine
understanding. 'Yes, yes. It is well known what children we
are. Pleased with a rattle!' Then, as if fearing he might be
going too far, he smiled that disarming smile of his, and said good-humouredly,
'I know now why you are called a good hostess.'</p>

<p>'Why?' asked the lady a little anxiously, for his compliments
were not always soothing.</p>

<p>A motion towards the watch-pocket. 'No one, to look at you,
would suppose that your spirit was racked between the clock and
the door.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' she said, relieved, 'if they come in five minutes or so,
you'll see! The dinner won't be a penny the worse. Jules is
such a wizard. All I mind is seeing Freddy fussed.' She turned
with an engaging smile to her minister again. 'Freddy has the
most angelic temper except when he's hungry&mdash;bless him! Now
that he's talking to Vida Levering, Freddy'll forget whether it's
before dinner or after.'</p>

<p>'What! what!' said a brisk old gentleman, with a face like
a peculiarly wicked monkey. He abandoned Mrs. Townley with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>enthusiasm in order to say to his hostess, 'Show me the witch who
can work that spell!'</p>

<p>'Oh, dear, I'm afraid,' said Mrs. Freddy, prettily, 'I'm dreadfully
afraid that means you're starving! Does it make you morose
as it does Freddy?' she asked, with an air of comic terror. 'Then
we won't wait.' She tossed out one arm with a funny little movement
that sent her thin draperies floating as though towards the
bell.</p>

<p>'My dear lady!' the old gentleman arrested her. 'I hunger, it is
true, but only for knowledge.' In a silent but rather horrible laugh
he wrinkled up his aged nose, which was quite enough wrinkled
and sufficiently 'up' already. 'Who <i>is</i> the witch?'</p>

<p>'Why, we were talking about a member of your family.' She
turned again to the new minister. 'Mr. Fox-Moore&mdash;Sir&mdash;oh!
how absurd! I was going to introduce two pillars of the
State to one another. I <i>must</i> be anxious about those late people,
after all.'</p>

<p>'As a matter of fact you and I never have met,' said Haycroft,
cordially taking old Mr. Fox-Moore's hand. 'Beside you permanent
officials we ephemer&aelig;, the sport of parties&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah, <i>that's</i> all right!' Mrs. Freddy's head, poised an instant
on one side, seemed to say.</p>

<p>'Who is it? Who is late?' demanded Mrs. Graham Townley,
whose entrance into the conversation produced the effect of the
sudden opening of window and door on a windy day. People
shrink a little in the draught, and all light, frivolous things are
blown out of the way. English people stand this sort of thing
very much as they stand the actual draughts in their cold houses.
They feel it to be good for them on the whole. Mrs. Graham
Townley was acknowledged to be a person of much character.
Though her interest in public affairs was bounded only by the
limits of the Empire, she had found time to reform the administration
of a great London hospital. Also she was related to a great
many people. In the ultra smart set she of course had no <i>raison
d'&ecirc;tre</i>, but in the older society it was held meet that these things
be. So that when she put her question, not only was she not
ignored, but each one felt it a serious thing for anybody to be so
late that Mrs. Graham Townley instead of button-holing some
one with, 'What, now, should you say is the extent of the Pan-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Islamic
influence in Egypt?' should be reduced to asking, 'Who
are we waiting for?'</p>

<p>'It's certain to be a man,' said Lady John Ulland, as calmly
convinced as one who states a natural law.</p>

<p>'Why?' asked her niece, the charming girl in rose colour.</p>

<p>'No woman would dare to come in so late as this. She'd have
turned back and telephoned that the horses had run away with her
or something of the sort.'</p>

<p>'Dick Farnborough won't turn back.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Mr. Farnborough's the culprit!' said a smartly dressed
woman, with a nervous, rather angry air, though the ropes of fine
pearls she wore might, some would think, have soothed the most
savage breast.</p>

<p>'Yes, Dick and Captain Beeching!' said Mrs. Freddy; 'and
I shall give them just two minutes more!'</p>

<p>'Aunt Ellen <i>said</i> it couldn't be a woman,' remarked the girl in
pink, as one struck with such perspicacity.</p>

<p>'Well, I wouldn't ask them again to <i>my</i> house,' said the discontented
person with the pearls.</p>

<p>'Yes, she would,' Lady John said aside to Borrodaile. 'She
has a daughter, and so have most of the London hostesses, and the
young villains know it.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes; sometimes they never turn up at all,' said the pink
niece.</p>

<p>'After accepting!' ejaculated Lady Whyteleafe of the pearls.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes; sometimes they don't even answer.'</p>

<p>'I never heard of such impudence.'</p>

<p>'I have, twice this year,' said Mrs. Graham Townley, with that
effect of breaking by main force into a conversation instead of
being drawn into it. 'Twice in this last year I've sat with an
empty place on one side of me at a dinner-party. On each occasion
it was a young member of parliament who never turned up
and never sent an apology.'</p>

<p>'The same man both times?' asked Lord Borrodaile.</p>

<p>'Yes; different houses, but the same man.'</p>

<p>'He <i>knew</i>!' whispered Borrodaile in Lady John's ear.</p>

<p>'Dick Farnborough has been complaining that since he smashed
his motor all existence has become disorganized. I always feel'&mdash;the
hostess addressed herself to the minister and the pearls&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>'don't
you, that one ought to stretch a point for people who have
to go about in cabs?'</p>

<p>As Haycroft began a disquisition on the changes in social life
initiated by the use of the motor-car, Mrs. Freddy floated away.</p>

<p>Borrodaile, looking after her, remarked, 'It's humane of my
sister-in-law to think of making allowances. Most of us gratify
the dormant cruelty in human nature by keeping an eagle eye on
the wretched late ones when at last they <i>do</i> slink in. Don't you
know'&mdash;he turned to Lady John&mdash;'that look of half-resentful
interest?'</p>

<p>'Perfectly. Every one wants to see whether these particular
culprits wear their rue with a difference.'</p>

<p>'Or whether,' Borrodaile went on, 'whether, like the majority,
they merely look abject and flustered, and whisper agitated lies.
Personally I have known it to be the most interesting moment of
the evening.'</p>

<p>What brought Mrs. Fox-Moore's plight forcibly home to Mrs.
Freddy was seeing Vida leave her own animated group to join
her sister. Mrs. Freddy made her way across the room, stopping
a moment to say to Freddy as she passed&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Do</i> go and make conversation to Lady Whyteleafe.'</p>

<p>'Which is Lady Whyteleafe?' drawled Freddy.</p>

<p>'Oh, you <i>always</i> forget her! What <i>am</i> I to do with you? She's
the woman with the pearls.'</p>

<p>'Not that cross-looking&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Sh! Yes, darling, that's the one. She's only looking like
that because you aren't talking to her;' and Mrs. Freddy overtook
Vida just as she reached the Desert Island where Mrs. Fox-Moore
stood, looking seaward for a sail.</p>

<p>A few moments later, after ringing for dinner, Mrs. Freddy
paused an instant, taking in the fact that Lady Whyteleafe hadn't
been made as happy by Mr. Tunbridge's attentions as his wife
had prophesied. No, the angry woman with the pearls, so far
from being intent upon Freddy's remarks, was levelling at Mrs.
Freddy the critical eye that says, 'Now I shall see if I can determine
just how miserably conscious you are that dinner's unpardonably
late, everybody starving, and since you've only just rung,
that you have at least eight minutes still to fill up before you'll hear
that you are "served."' Lady Whyteleafe leaned against the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>back of the little periwinkle damask sofa, and waited to see Mrs.
Freddy carry off these last minutes of suspense by an affectation
of great good spirits.</p>

<p>But the lady under the social microscope knew a trick worth
two of that. She could turn more than one mishap to account.</p>

<p>'Oh, Freddy! Oh, Lady Whyteleafe! I've just gone and said
the most awful, dreadful, appalling thing! Oh, I should like to
creep under the sofa and die!'</p>

<p>'What's up?' demanded Mr. Freddy, with an air of relief at
being reinforced.</p>

<p>'I've been talking to Vida Levering and that funereal sister of
hers.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Mrs. Fox-Moore!' said Lady Whyteleafe, obviously disappointed.
'She's a step-sister, isn't she?'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes. Oh, I wish she'd never stepped over my threshold!'</p>

<p>'Why?' said Mr. Freddy, sticking in his <a name="Page_17t" id="Page_17t"></a><a href="#Page_17tn">eyeglass</a>.</p>

<p>'Don't, Freddy. Don't look at her. Oh, I wish I were dead!'</p>

<p>'What <i>have</i> you been doing? She looks as if she wished <i>she</i>
were dead.'</p>

<p>'That's nothing. She always looks like that,' Lady Whyteleafe
assured the pair.</p>

<p>'Yes, and she makes it a great favour to come. "I seldom go
into society," she writes in her stiff little notes; and you're reminded
that way, without her actually setting it down, that she
devotes herself to good works.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps she doesn't know what else to do with all that money,'
said the lady of the pearls.</p>

<p>'<i>She</i> hasn't got a penny piece.'</p>

<p>'Oh, is it all his? I thought the Leverings were rather well off.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but the money came through the second wife, Vida's
mother. Oh, I hate that Fox-Moore woman!' Mrs. Freddy
laughed ruefully. 'And I'm sure her husband is a great deal too
good for her. But how <i>could</i> I have done it!'</p>

<p>'You haven't told us yet.'</p>

<p>'They asked me who was late, and I said Dick Farnborough,
and that I hoped he hadn't forgotten, for I had Hermione Heriot
here on purpose to meet him. And I told Vida about the Heriots
trying to marry Hermione to that old Colonel Redding.'</p>

<p>'Oh, can't they bring it off?' said Lady Whyteleafe.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>'I've been afraid they would. "It's so dreadful," I said, "to
see a fresh young girl tied to a worn-out old man."'</p>

<p>'<i>Oh!</i>' remarked Lady Whyteleafe, genuinely shocked. 'And
you said that to&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Mrs. Freddy nodded with melancholy significance. 'Even when
Vida said, "It seems to do well enough sometimes," <i>still</i> I never
never remembered the Fox-Moore story! And I went on about
it being a miracle when it turned out even tolerably&mdash;and, oh,
Heaven forgive me! I grew eloquent!'</p>

<p>'It's your passion for making speeches,' said Mr. Freddy.</p>

<p>At which, accountably to Lady Whyteleafe, Mrs. Freddy blushed
and stumbled in this particular 'speech.'</p>

<p>'I know, I know,' she said, carrying it off with an air of comic
contrition. 'I even said, "There's a modesty in nature that it
isn't wise to overstep" (I'd forgotten some people think speech-making
comes under that head). "It's been realized," I said&mdash;yes,
rushing on my doom!&mdash;"it's been realized up to now only
in the usual one-sided way&mdash;discouraging boys from marrying
women old enough to be their mothers. But dear, blundering,
fatuous man"'&mdash;she smiled into her husband's pleasantly mocking
face&mdash;'"<i>he</i> thinks," I said, "at <i>any</i> age he's a fit mate for a
fresh young creature in her teens. If they only knew&mdash;the dreadful
old ogres!" Yes, I said that. I piled it on&mdash;oh, I stuck at
nothing! "The men think an ugly old woman monopolizes all the
opportunities humanity offers for repulsiveness. But there's nothing
on the face of the earth as hideous," I said, "as an ugly old
man. Doesn't it stand to reason? He's bound to go greater
lengths than any woman can aspire to. There's more of him to
<i>be</i> ugly, isn't there? I appealed to them&mdash;everything about him
is bigger, coarser&mdash;he's much less human," says I, "and <i>much</i>
more like a dreadful old monkey." I raised my wretched eyes, and
there, not three feet away, was the aged husband of the Fox-Moore
woman ogling Hermione Heriot! Oh, let me die!' Mrs. Freddy
leaned against the blue-grey sofa for a moment and half closed her
pretty eyes. The next instant she was running gaily across the
room to welcome Richard Farnborough and Captain Beeching.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>'I always know,' said Lord Borrodaile, glancing over the banisters
as he and Vida went down&mdash;'I always know the kind of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>party it's going to be when I see&mdash;certain people. Don't
you?'</p>

<p>'I know who you mean,' Vida whispered back, her eyes on Mrs.
Graham Townley's aggressively high-piled hair towering over the
bald pate of the minister, as, side by side, they disappeared through
the dining-room door. 'Why <i>does</i> Laura have her?'</p>

<p>'Well, she's immensely intelligent, they <i>say</i>,' he sighed.</p>

<p>'That's why I wonder,' laughed Vida. '<i>We</i> are rather frivolous,
I'm afraid.'</p>

<p>'To tell the truth, I wondered, too. I even sounded my sister-in-law.'</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'She said it was her Day of Reckoning. "I never ask the
woman," she said, "except to a scratch party like this."'</p>

<p>'"Scratch party"&mdash;with you and me here!'</p>

<p>'Ah, we are the leaven. We make the compound possible.'</p>

<p>'Still, I don't think she ought to call it "scratch" when she's
got an Ambassador and a Cabinet Minister&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Just the party to ask a scratch Cabinet Minister to,' he insisted,
stopping between the two cards inscribed respectively with their
names. 'As for the Ambassador, he's an old friend of ours&mdash;knows
his London well&mdash;knows we are the most tolerant society
on the face of the earth.'</p>

<p>In spite of her companion's affectation of a smiling quarrelsomeness,
Vida unfolded her table-napkin with the air of one
looking forward to her <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with the man who had brought
her down. But Lord Borrodaile was a person most women liked
talking to, and hardly had she begun to relish that combination in
the man of careless pleasantry and pungent criticism, when Vida
caught an agonized glance from her hostess, which said plainly,
'Rescue the man on your right,'&mdash;and lo! Miss Levering became
aware that already, before the poor jaded politician had swallowed
his soup, Mrs. Townley had fallen to catechising him about the
new Bill&mdash;a theme talked threadbare by newspaperdom and all
political England. But Mrs. Townley, albeit not exactly old, was
one of those old-fashioned women who take what used to be called
'an intelligent interest in politics.' You may pick her out in
any drawing-room from the fact that politicians shun her like the
plague. Rich, childless, lonely, with more wits than occupation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>practically shelved at a time when her intellectual life is most
alert&mdash;the Mrs. Townleys of the world do, it must be admitted,
labour under the delusion that men fighting the battle of public
life, go out to dine for the express purpose of telling the intelligent
female 'all about it.' She is a staunch believer not so much in
women's influence as in woman's. And there is no doubt in her
mind which woman's. If among her smart relations who ask her
to their houses and go to hers (from that sentiment of the solidarity
of the family so powerful in English life), if amongst these she succeeds
from time to time in inducing two or three public officials,
or even private members, to prove how good a cook she keeps, she
thinks she is exercising an influence on the politics of her time. Her
form of conversation consists in plying her victim with questions.
Not here one there one, to keep the ball rolling, but a steady and
pitiless fire of 'Do you think?' and '<i>Why</i> do you?'</p>

<p>Obedient to her hostess's wireless telegram, Miss Levering bent
her head, and said to Mrs. Townley's neighbour&mdash;</p>

<p>'I know I ought not to talk to you till after the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>.'</p>

<p>'Pray do!' said Sir William, with a sudden glint in his little
eyes; and then with a burnt-child air of caution, 'Unless&mdash;&mdash;'
he began.</p>

<p>'Oh, you make conditions!' said Miss Levering, laughing.</p>

<p>'Only one. Promise not'&mdash;he lowered his voice&mdash;'promise
not to say "Bill."'</p>

<p>'I won't even go so far as to say "William."'</p>

<p>He laughed as obligingly as though the jest had been a good
one. A little ashamed, its maker hastened to leave it behind.</p>

<p>'There's nothing I should quite so much hate talking about as
politics&mdash;saving your presence.'</p>

<p>'Ah!'</p>

<p>'I was thinking of something <i>much</i> more important.'</p>

<p>Even her rallying tone did not wholly reassure the poor man.</p>

<p>'More important?' he repeated.</p>

<p>'Yes; I long to know (and I long to be forgiven for asking),
what Order that is you are wearing, and what you did to get
it.'</p>

<p>Haycroft breathed freely. He talked for the next ten minutes
about the bauble, making a humorous translation of its Latin
'posy,' and describing in the same vein the service to a foreign
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>state that had won him the recognition. He wouldn't have worn
the thing to-night except out of compliment to the ambassador
from the Power in question. They were going on together to the
reception at the Foreign Office. As to the Order, Haycroft seemed
to feel he owed it to himself to smile at all such toys, but he did
not disdain to amuse the pretty lady with the one in question, any
more than being humane (and even genial sitting before Mrs.
Freddy's menu), he would have refused to show the whirring wheels
of his watch to a nice child. The two got on so well that the anxious
look quite faded out of Mrs. Freddy's face, and she devoted herself
gaily to the distinguished foreigner at her side. But Haycroft at
a party was, like so many Englishmen, as the lilies of the field.
They toil not, neither do they spin. The man Vida had rescued
from Mrs. Graham Townley was, when in the society of women,
so accustomed to seeing them take on themselves the onus of
entertainment, was himself so unused to being at the smallest
trouble, that when the 'Order' was exhausted, had Vida not invented
another topic, there would have been an absolute cessation
of all converse till Mrs. Graham Townley had again caught him
up like a big reluctant fish on the hook of interrogation. At a
reproachful aside from Lord Borrodaile, Miss Levering broke off
in the middle of her second subject to substitute, 'But I am monopolizing
you disgracefully,' and she half turned away from the
eminent politician into whose slightly flushed face and humid eyes
had come something like animation.</p>

<p>'Not at all. Not at all. Go on.'</p>

<p>'No, I've gone far enough. Do you realize that we left "Orders"
and "Honours" half an hour ago, and ever since we've been talking
scandal?'</p>

<p>'Criticizing life,' he amended&mdash;'a pursuit worthy of two
philosophers.'</p>

<p>'I did it&mdash;' said the lady, with an air of half-amused discontent
with herself; 'you know why I did it.'</p>

<p>He met her eye, and the faint motion that indicated the woman
on his other side. 'Terrible person,' he whispered. 'She goes
out to dine as a soldier goes into action.'</p>

<p>For the next few minutes they made common cause in heaping
ridicule on 'the political woman.'</p>

<p>'But, after all'&mdash;Vida pulled herself up&mdash;'it may be only a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>case of sour grapes on my part. I'm afraid <i>my</i> conversation is
inclined to be frivolous.'</p>

<p>He turned and gave her her reward&mdash;the feeling smile that
says, '<i>Thank God!</i>' But, strangely, it did not reflect itself in the
woman's face. Something quite different there, lurking under
the soft gaiety. Was it consciousness of this being the second time
during the evening that she had employed the too common vaunt
of the woman of that particular world? Did some ironic echo
reach her of that same boast (often as mirthless and as pitiful as
the painted smile on the cruder face), the 'I'm afraid I'm rather
frivolous' of the well-to-do woman, whose frivolity&mdash;invaluable
asset!&mdash;is beginning to show wear?</p>

<p>'Well, to return to our mutton,' he said; and, as his companion
seemed suddenly to be overtaken by some unaccountable qualm,
'What a desert life would be,' he added encouragingly, 'if we
couldn't talk to the discreet about the indiscreet.'</p>

<p>'I wonder if there wouldn't be still more oases in the desert,'
she said idly, 'if there were a new law made&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He glanced at her with veiled apprehension in the pause.</p>

<p>'You being so Liberal,' she went on with faint mockery, 'you're
the very one to introduce the measure' (he shrank visibly, and
seemed about to remind her of her pledge). 'It shall ordain,' she
went on, 'that those who have found satisfactory husbands or
wives are to rest content with their good fortune, and not be so
greedy as to insist on having the children, too.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' His gravity relaxed.</p>

<p>'But, on the other hand, all the lonely women, the widows and
spinsters, who haven't got anything else, <i>they</i> shall have the
children.'</p>

<p>'I won't go so far as that,' he laughed, boundlessly relieved that
the conversation was not taking the strenuous turn he for a moment
feared. 'But I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll support a measure
that shall make an allowance of <i>one</i> child to every single woman
the proper and accepted arrangement. No questions asked, and
no disgrace.'</p>

<p>'Disgrace!' she echoed, smiling. 'On the contrary, it should
be the woman's title to honour! She should be given a beautiful
Order like yours for service to the State.'</p>

<p>'Ah, yes! But, what then would we talk about?'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>She had turned away definitely this time.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Borrodaile, a little mocking, 'what is it?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' she answered. 'I don't know <i>what</i> it is that
seizes hold of me after I've been chattering like this for an hour
or more.'</p>

<p>Borrodaile bent his head, and glanced past Vida to the abandoned
minister.</p>

<p>'Console me by saying a slight weariness.'</p>

<p>'More like loathing.'</p>

<p>'Not of <i>both</i> your neighbours, I hope.'</p>

<p>He lost the low 'Of myself.' 'But there's one person,' she said,
with something like enthusiasm&mdash;'one person that I respect and
admire.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' He glanced about the board with an air of lazy interest.
'Which one?'</p>

<p>'I don't know her name. I mean the woman who dares to sit
quite silent and eat her dinner without looking like a lost soul.'</p>

<p>'I've been saying you could do that.'</p>

<p>She shook her head. 'No, I've been engaged for the last hour
in proving I haven't the courage. It's just come over me,' she
said, her eyes in their turn making a tour of the table, and coming
back to Borrodaile with the look of having caught up a bran-new
topic on the way&mdash;'it's just come over me, what we're all doing.'</p>

<p>'Are we all doing the same thing?'</p>

<p>'All the men are doing one thing. And all the women another.'</p>

<p>His idly curious look travelled up and down, and returned to her
unenlightened.</p>

<p>'All the women,' she said, 'are trying with might and main to
amuse the men, and all the men are more or less permitting the
women to succeed.'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry,' he said, laughing, 'to hear of your being so over-worked.'</p>

<p>'Oh, <i>you</i> make it easy. And yet'&mdash;she caught the gratitude
away from her voice&mdash;'I suppose I should have said something
like that, even if I'd been talking to my other neighbour.'</p>

<p>Borrodaile's look went again from one couple to another, for,
as usual in England, the talk was all <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>. The result of
his inspection seemed not to lend itself to her mood.</p>

<p>'I can't speak for others, but for myself, I'm always conscious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>of wanting to be agreeable when I'm with you. I'm sorry'&mdash;he
was speaking in the usual half-genial, half-jeering tone&mdash;'very
sorry, if I succeed so ill.'</p>

<p>'I've already admitted that with <i>me</i> you succeed to admiration.
But you only try because it's easy.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' he laughed.</p>

<p>'You rather like talking to me, you know. Now, can you lay
your hand on your heart&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And deny it? Never!'</p>

<p>'Can you lay your hand on your heart, and say you've tried as
hard to entertain your other neighbour as I have to keep mine
going?'</p>

<p>'Ah, well, we men aren't as good at it. After all, it's rather the
woman's "part," isn't it?'</p>

<p>'The art of pleasing? I suppose it is&mdash;but it's rather a Geisha
view of life, don't you think?'</p>

<p>'Not at all; rightly viewed, it's a woman's privilege&mdash;her
natural function.'</p>

<p>'Then the brutes are nobler than we.'</p>

<p>Wondering, he glanced at her. The face was wholly reassuring,
but he said, with a faint uneasiness&mdash;</p>

<p>'If it weren't you, I'd say that sounds a little bitter.'</p>

<p>'Oh, no,' she laughed. 'I was only thinking about the lion's
mane and the male bird's crest, and what the natural history bores
say they're for.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>The darkness and the quiet of Vida Levering's bedroom were
rudely dispelled at a punctual eight each morning by the entrance
of a gaunt middle-aged female.</p>

<p>It was this person's unvarying custom to fling back the heavy
curtains, as though it gratified some strong recurrent need in her,
to hear brass rings run squealing along a bar; as if she counted
that day lost which was not well begun&mdash;by shooting the blinds
up with a clatter and a bang!</p>

<p>The harsh ceremonial served as a sort of setting of the pace,
or a metaphorical shaking of a bony fist in the face of the day, as
much as to say, 'If I admit you here you'll have to toe the mark!'</p>

<p>It might be taken as proof of sound nerves that the lady in the
bed offered no remonstrance at being jarred awake in this ungentle
fashion.</p>

<p>Fourteen years before, when Vida Levering was only eighteen,
she had tried to make something like a conventional maid out of
the faithful Northumbrian. Rachel Wark had entered Lady
Levering's service just before Vida's birth, and had helped to
nurse her mistress through a mortal illness ten years later. After
Sir Hervey Levering lost his wife, Wark became in time housekeeper
and general factotum to the family. This arrangement
held without a break until, as before hinted, Miss Vida, full of
the hopeful idealism of early youth, had tried and ignominiously
failed in her attempt to teach the woman gentler manners.</p>

<p>For Wark's characteristic retort had been to pack her box and
go to spend sixteen months among her kinsfolk, where energy was
accounted a virtue, and smooth ways held in suspicion. At the
end of that time, seeming to judge the lesson she wished to impart
had been sufficiently digested, Wark wrote to Miss Vida proposing
to come back. For some months she waited for the answer. It
came at last from Biarritz, where it appeared the young lady was
spending the winter with her father. After an exchange of letters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Wark joined them there. In the twelve years since her return to
the family, she had by degrees adapted herself to the task of looking
after her young lady. The adaptation was not all on one side.
Many of Vida's friends wondered that she could put up with a
lady's maid who could do so few of the things commonly expected
of that accomplished class.</p>

<p>'I don't want dressmaking going on in the house,' contentedly
Vida told off her maid's negative qualifications, 'and I hate having
anybody do my hair for me. Wark packs quite beautifully, and
then I <i>do</i> like some one about me&mdash;that I like.'</p>

<p>In the early days what she had 'liked' most about the woman
was that Wark had known and been attached to Lady Levering.
There was no one else with whom Vida could talk about her mother.</p>

<p>By the time death overtook Sir Hervey two winters ago in Rome,
Wark had become so essential a part of Vida's little entourage,
that one of the excuses offered by that lady for not going to live
with her half-sister in London had been&mdash;'Wark doesn't always
get on with other servants.' For several years Miss Levering's
friends had been speaking of her as one fallen a victim to that
passion for Italy that makes it an abiding place dearer than home
to so many English-born. But the half-sister, Mrs. Fox-Moore,
had not been misled either by that theory or by the difficulty as to
pleasing Wark with the Queen Anne's Gate servants. 'It's not
that Vida loves Italy so much as that, for some reason, she doesn't
love England at all.' Nevertheless, Mrs. Fox-Moore after some
months had persuaded her to 'bring Wark and try us.'</p>

<p>The experiment, now over a year old, seemed to have turned
out well. If Vida really did not love her native land, she seemed
to enjoy well enough what she called smiling 'the St. Martin's
Summer' of her success in London society.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>She turned over in her bed on this particular May morning,
stretching out her long figure, and then letting it sink luxuriously
back into relaxed quiescence with a conscious joy in prolonging
those last ten minutes when sleep is slowly, softly, one after another,
withdrawing her thousand veils.</p>

<p>Vaguely, as she lay there with face half buried in her pillow,
vaguely she was aware that Wark was making even more noise
than common.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>When the woman had bustled in and bustled out several times,
and deposited the shoes with a 'dump,' she reappeared with the
delicate porcelain tray that bore the early tea. On the little table
close to where the dark head lay half hidden, Wark set the fragile
burden down&mdash;did it with an emphasis that made cup and saucer
shiver and run for support towards the round-bellied pot.</p>

<p>Vida opened her heavy-lidded eyes. 'Really, Wark, you know,
nobody on earth would let you wake them in the morning except
me.' She sat up and pulled the pillow higher. 'Give me the
tray here,' she said sleepily.</p>

<p>Wark obeyed. She had said nothing to Vida's reproof. She
stood now by the bedside without a trace of either contrition or
resentment in the wooden face that seemed, in recompense for
never having been young, to be able successfully to defy the 'antique
pencil.' Time had made but one or two faint ineffectual scratches
there, as one who tries, and then abandons, an unpromising surface.
The lack of record in the face lent it something almost
cryptic. If there were no laughter-wrought lines about the eyes,
neither was there mark of grief or self-repression near the mouth.
She would, you felt, defy Time as successfully as she defied lesser
foes. Even the lank, straw-coloured hair hardly showed the
streaks of yellow-white that offered their unemphatic clue to Wark's
age.</p>

<p>The sensitive face of the woman in the bed&mdash;even now with
something of the peace of sleep still shadowing its brilliancy&mdash;gave
by contrast an impression of vividness and eager sympathies.
The mistress, too, looked younger than her years. She did not
seem to wonder at the dull presence that seemed to be held there,
prisoner-like, behind the brass bars at the foot of the bed. Wark
sometimes gave herself this five minutes' <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with her mistress
before the business of the day began and all their intercourse
was swamped in clothes.</p>

<p>'I meant to pin a paper on the door to say I wasn't to be called
till ten,' said the lady, as though keeping up the little pretence of
not being pleased.</p>

<p>'Didn't you sleep well, 'm?' The maid managed wholly to
denude the question of its usual grace of solicitude.</p>

<p>'Yes; but it was so late when I began. We didn't get back till
nearly three.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>'I didn't get much sleep, either.' It was an unheard-of admission
from Wark.</p>

<p>'Oh!' said Vida, lazily sipping her tea. 'Bad conscience?'</p>

<p>'No,' she said slowly, 'no.'</p>

<p>As the woman raised her light eyes, Miss Levering saw, to her
astonishment, that the lids were red. Wark, too, seemed uncomfortably
aware of something unusual in her face, for she turned it
away, and busied herself in smoothing down the near corner of the
bath blanket.</p>

<p>'What kept <i>you</i> awake?' Miss Levering asked.</p>

<p>'Well, I suppose I'd better tell you while the other people aren't
round. I want a day or two to go into the country.'</p>

<p>'Into the country?' No such request had been heard for a
round dozen of years.</p>

<p>'I've got some business to see to.'</p>

<p>'At home? In Northumberland?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>The tone seemed so little to promise anything in the nature of a
confidence that Miss Levering merely said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, very well. When do you want to go?'</p>

<p>'I could go to-morrow if&mdash;&mdash;' She stopped, and looked down
at the hem of her long white apron.</p>

<p>Something unwonted in the wooden face prompted Miss Levering
to say&mdash;</p>

<p>'What do you want to do in the country?'</p>

<p>'To see about a place that's been offered me.'</p>

<p>'A <i>place</i>, Wark!'</p>

<p>'Yes; post of housekeeper. That's what I really am, you
know.'</p>

<p>Miss Levering looked at her, and set down the half-finished cup
without opening her lips. If the speech had come from any other
than Wark, it would have been easy to believe it merely the prelude
to complaint of a fellow-servant or plea for a rise in wages. But if
Wark objected to a fellow-servant, her own view of the matter had
always been that the other one should go. Her mistress knew quite
well that in the mouth of the woman standing there with red eyes
at the foot of the bed, such an announcement as had just been
made, meant more. And the consciousness seemed to bring with
it a sense of acute discomfort not unmixed with anger. For there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>was a threat of something worse than an infliction of mere inconvenience.
It was a species of desertion. It was almost treachery.
They had lived together all the younger woman's life, except for
those two years that followed on the girl's attempt to make a conventional
servant out of a creature who couldn't be that, but who
had it in her to be more.</p>

<p>They had been too long together for Wark not to divine something&mdash;through
all the lady's self-possession&mdash;of her sense of
being abandoned.</p>

<p>'It's having to tell you that that kept me awake.'</p>

<p>The wave of dull colour that mounted up to the bushy, straw-coloured
eyebrows seemed on the way to have overflowed into her
eyes. They grew redder than before, and slowly they filled.</p>

<p>'You don't like living here in this house.' Vida caught at the
old complication.</p>

<p>'I've got used to it,' the woman said baldly. Then, after a
little pause, during which she made a barely audible rasping to
clear her throat, 'I don't like leaving you, miss. I always remember
how, that time before&mdash;the only time I was ever away from
you since you was a baby&mdash;how different I found you when I
came back.'</p>

<p>'Different, Wark?'</p>

<p>'Yes, miss. It seemed like you'd turned into somebody
else.'</p>

<p>'Most people change&mdash;develope&mdash;in those years just before
twenty.'</p>

<p>'Not like you did, miss. You gave me a deal of trouble when
you was little, but it nearly broke my heart to come back and find
you so quieted down and wise-like.'</p>

<p>A flash of tears glimmered in the mistress's eyes, though her lips
were smiling.</p>

<p>'Of course,' the maid went on, 'though you never told me about
it, I know you had things to bear while I was away, or else you
wouldn't have gone away from your home that time&mdash;a mere
child&mdash;and tried to teach for a living.'</p>

<p>'It <i>was</i> absurd of me! But whosever fault it was, it wasn't
yours.'</p>

<p>'Yes, miss, in a way it was. I owed it to your mother not to
have left you. I've never told you how I blamed myself when I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>heard&mdash;and I didn't wonder at you. It <i>was</i> hard when your
mother was hardly cold to see your father&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes; now that's enough, Wark. You know we never speak of
that.'</p>

<p>'No, we've never spoken about it. And, of course, you won't
need me any more like you did then. But it's looking back and
remembering&mdash;it's that that's making it so hard to leave you
now. But&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'My friends have been talking to me.'</p>

<p>'About&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, this post.' Then, almost angrily, 'I didn't try for it.
It's come after me. My cousin knows the man.'</p>

<p>'The man who wants you to go to him as housekeeper?' Vida
wrinkled her brows. Wark hadn't said 'gentleman,' who alone
in her employer's experience had any need of a housekeeper. 'You
mean you don't know him yourself?'</p>

<p>'Not yet, 'm. I know he's a market gardener, and he wants
his house looked after.'</p>

<p>'What if he does? A market gardener won't be able to pay
the wages I&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The wages aren't much to begin with&mdash;but he's getting along&mdash;except
for the housekeeping. That's in a bad way.'</p>

<p>'What if it is? I never heard such nonsense. You don't want
to leave me, Wark, for a market gardener you've never so much as
seen;' and Miss Levering covered her discomfort by a little smiling.</p>

<p>'My cousin's seen him many a time. She likes him.'</p>

<p>'Let your cousin go, then, and keep his house for him.'</p>

<p>'My cousin has her own house to keep, and she's got a young
baby.'</p>

<p>'Oh, the woman who brought her child here once?'</p>

<p>'Yes, 'm, the child you gave the coral beads to. My cousin has
written and talked about it ever since.'</p>

<p>'About the beads?'</p>

<p>'About the market gardener. And the way his house is&mdash;Ever
since we came back to England she's been going on at me
about it. I told her all along I couldn't leave you, but she's
always said (since that day you walked about with the baby and
gave him the beads to play with, and wouldn't let her make him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>cry by taking them away)&mdash;ever since then my cousin has said
you'd understand.'</p>

<p>'What would I understand?'</p>

<p>Wark laid her hand on the nearest of the shining bars of brass,
and slowly she polished it with her open palm. She obviously
found it difficult to go on with her defence.</p>

<p>'I wanted my cousin to come and explain to you.'</p>

<p>Here was Wark in a new light indeed! If she really wanted
any creature on the earth to speak for her. As she stood there in
stolid embarrassment polishing the shiny bar, Miss Levering
clutched the tray to steady it, and with the other hand she pulled
the pillow higher. One had to sit bolt upright, it seemed, and give
this matter one's entire attention.</p>

<p>'I don't want to talk to your cousin about your affairs. We are
old friends, Wark. Tell me yourself.'</p>

<p>She forced her eyes to meet her mistress's. 'He told my cousin:
"Just you find me a good housekeeper," he said, "and if I like
her," he said, "she won't be my housekeeper long."'</p>

<p>'Wark! <i>You!</i> You aren't thinking of marrying?'</p>

<p>'If he's what my cousin says&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'A man you've never seen? Oh, my <i>dear</i> Wark! Well, I shall
hope and pray he won't think your housekeeping good enough.'</p>

<p>'He will! From what my cousin says, he's had a run of worthless
huzzies. I don't expect he'll find much fault with <i>my</i> housekeeping
after what he's been through.'</p>

<p>Vida looked wondering at the triumphant face of the woman.</p>

<p>'And so you're ready to leave me after all these years?'</p>

<p>'No, miss, I'm not to say "ready," but I think I'll have to go.'</p>

<p>'My poor old Wark'&mdash;the lady leaned over the tray&mdash;'I could
almost think you are in love with this man you've only heard about!'</p>

<p>'No, miss, I'm not to say in love.'</p>

<p>'I believe you are! For what other reason would you have for
leaving me?'</p>

<p>The woman looked as if she could show cause had she a mind.
But she said nothing.</p>

<p>'You know,' Vida pursued&mdash;'you know quite well you don't
need to marry for a home.'</p>

<p>'No, 'm; I'm quite comfortable, of course, with you. But time
goes on. I don't get younger.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>'None of us do that, Wark.'</p>

<p>'That's just the trouble, miss. It ain't only <i>me</i>.'</p>

<p>Vida looked at her, more perplexed than ever by the curious
regard in the hard-featured countenance. For there was something
very like dumb reproach in Wark's face.</p>

<p>'Still,' said Miss Levering, 'you know, even if none of us do get
younger, we are not any of us (to judge by appearances) on the
brink of the grave. Even if I should be smashed up in a motor
accident&mdash;I know you're always expecting that&mdash;even if I were
killed to-morrow, still you'd find I hadn't forgotten you, Wark.'</p>

<p>'It isn't that, miss. It isn't death I'm afraid of.'</p>

<p>There was a pause&mdash;the longest that yet had come.</p>

<p>'What <i>are</i> you afraid of?' Miss Levering asked.</p>

<p>'It's&mdash;you see, I've been looking these twelve years to see you
married.'</p>

<p>'Me? What's that got to do with&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, miss. You see, I've counted a good while on looking after
children again some day. But if you won't get married&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Vida flung her hair back with a burst of not very merry laughter.</p>

<p>'If I won't, you must! But <i>why</i> in the world? I'd no idea
you were so romantic. Why must there be a wedding in the
family, Wark?'</p>

<p>'So there can be children, miss,' said the woman, stolidly.</p>

<p>'Well, there is a child. There's Doris.'</p>

<p>'Poor Miss Doris!' The woman shook her head. 'But she's
got a good nurse. I say it, though she calls advice interfering.
And Miss Doris has got a mother' (plain that Wark was again in
the market garden). 'Yes, <i>she's</i> got a mother! and a sort of a
father, and she's got a governess, and a servant to carry her about.
I sometimes think what Miss Doris needs most is a little letting
alone. Leastways, she don't need <i>me</i>. No, nor <i>you</i>, miss.'</p>

<p>'And you've given me up?' the mistress probed.</p>

<p>Wark raised her red eyes. 'Of course, miss, if I'm wrong&mdash;&mdash;'
Her knuckly hand slid down from the brass bar, and she came
round to the side of the bed with an unmistakable eagerness in
her face. 'If you're going to get married, I don't see as I <i>could</i>
leave ye.'</p>

<p>The lady's lips twitched with an instant's silent laughter, but
there was something else than laughter in her eyes.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh, I <i>can</i> buy you off, can I? If I give you my word&mdash;if to
save you from need to try the great experiment, I'll sacrifice
<i>my</i>self&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't like to see you make a sacrifice, miss,' Wark said,
with perfect gravity. 'But'&mdash;as though reconsidering&mdash;'you
wouldn't feel it so much, I dare say, after the child was there.'</p>

<p>They looked at one another.</p>

<p>'If it's children you yearn for, my poor Wark, you've waited too
long, I'm afraid.'</p>

<p>'Oh, no, miss.' She spoke with a fatuous confidence.</p>

<p>'Why, you must be fifty.'</p>

<p>'Fifty-three, miss. But'&mdash;she met her mistress's eye unflinching&mdash;'Bunting&mdash;he's
the market gardener&mdash;he's been
married before. He's got three girls and two boys.'</p>

<p>'Heavens!' Vida fell back against the pillow. 'What a handful!'</p>

<p>'Oh, no, 'm. My cousin says they're nice children.' It would
have been funny if it hadn't somehow been pathetic to see how
instantly she was on the defensive. '"Healthy and hearty," my
cousin says, all but the little one. She hardly thinks they'll raise
<i>him</i>.'</p>

<p>'Well, I wish your market gardener had confined himself to
raising onions and cabbages. If he hadn't those children I don't
believe you'd dream of&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well, of course not, miss. But it seems like those children
need some one to look after them more than&mdash;more than&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Than I do? That ought to be true.'</p>

<p>'One of 'em is little more than a baby.' The wooden woman
offered it as an apology.</p>

<p>'Take the tray,' said Vida.</p>

<p>From the look on her face you would say she knew she had lost
the faithfullest of servants, and that five little children somewhere
in a market garden had won, if not a mother, at least a doughty
champion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>No matter how late either Vida Levering or her half-sister had
gone to bed the night before, they breakfasted, as they did so many
other things, at the hour held to be most advantageous for Doris.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox-Moore was sometimes there and often not. On those
mornings when his health or his exertions the night previous did
not prevent his appearance, there was little conversation at the
Fox-Moore breakfast table, except such as was initiated by the
only child of the marriage, a fragile girl of ten. Little Doris,
owing to some obscure threat of hip-disease, made much of her
progress about the house in a footman's arms. But hardly, so
borne, would she reach the threshold of the breakfast room before
her thin little voice might be heard calling out, '<i>Fa</i>-ther! <i>Fa</i>-ther!'</p>

<p>Those who held they had every ground for disliking the old man
would have been surprised to watch him during the half hour that
ensued, ministering to the rather querulous little creature, adapting
his tone and view to her comprehension, with an art that plainly
took its inspiration from affection. If Doris were not well enough
to come down, Mr. Fox-Moore read his letters and glanced at
'the' paper, directing his few remarks to his sister-in-law, whom
he sometimes treated in such a way as would have given a stranger
the impression, in spite of the lady's lack of response, that there
was some secret understanding between the two.</p>

<p>A great many years before, Donald Fox-Moore had tumbled
into a Government office, the affairs of which he had ultimately
got into such excellent running order, that, with a few hours'
supervision from the chief each week, his clerks were easily able
to maintain the high reputation of that particular department of
the public service. What Mr. Fox-Moore did with the rest of
his time was little known. A good deal of it was spent with a
much younger bachelor brother near Brighton. At least, this was
the family legend. In spite of his undoubted affection for his
child, little of his leisure was wasted at home. When people looked
at the sallow, smileless face of his wife they didn't blame him.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, when a general sense of tension and anxiety betrayed
his presence somewhere in the great dreary house, and the master
yet forbore to descend for the early meal, he would rejoice the
heart of his little daughter by having her brought to his room to
make tea and share his breakfast.</p>

<p>On these occasions a sense of such unexpected surcease from
care prevailed in the dining-room as called for some celebration
of the holiday spirit. It found expression in the inclination of the
two women to linger over their coffee, embracing the only sure
opportunity the day offered for confidential exchange.</p>

<p>One of these occasions was the morning of Wark's warning,
which, however, Vida determined to say nothing about till she was
obliged. She had just handed up her cup for replenishing when
the door opened, and, to the surprise of the ladies, the master of
the house appeared on the threshold.</p>

<p>'Is&mdash;is anything the matter?' faltered his wife, half rising.</p>

<p>'Matter? Must something be the matter that I venture into
my own breakfast-room of a morning?'</p>

<p>'No, no. Only I thought, as Doris didn't come, you were
breakfasting upstairs, too.' No notice being taken of this, she at
once set about heating water, for no one expected Mr. Fox-Moore
to drink tea made in the kitchen.</p>

<p>'I thought,' said he, twitching an open newspaper off the table
and folding it up&mdash;'I thought I asked to be allowed the privilege
of opening my paper for myself.'</p>

<p>'Your <i>Times</i> hasn't been touched,' said his wife, anxiously
occupied with the spirit-lamp.</p>

<p>He stopped in the act of thrusting the paper in his pocket and
shook it.</p>

<p>'What do you call this?'</p>

<p>'That is my <i>Times</i>,' she said.</p>

<p>'<i>Your</i> <i>Times</i>?'</p>

<p>'I ordered an extra copy, because you dislike so to have yours
looked at till you've finished with it.'</p>

<p>'Dreadful hardship <i>that</i> is!' he said, glancing round, and seeing
his own particular paper neatly folded and lying still on the side
table.</p>

<p>'It was no great hardship when you read it before night. When
you don't, it's rather long to wait.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>'To wait for what?'</p>

<p>'For the news of the day.'</p>

<p>'Don't you get the news of the day in the <i>Morning Post</i>?'</p>

<p>'I don't get such full Parliamentary reports nor the foreign
correspondence.'</p>

<p>'Good Lord! what next?'</p>

<p>'I think you must blame me,' said Vida, speaking for the first
time. 'I'm afraid you'll find it's only since I've been here that
Janet has broken loose and taken in an extra copy.'</p>

<p>'Oh, it's on your account, is it?' he grumbled, but the edge had
gone out of his ill-humour. 'I suppose you <i>have</i> to keep up with
politics or you couldn't keep the ball rolling as you did last night?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Vida, with an innocent air. 'It is well known what
superhuman efforts we have to make before we can qualify ourselves
to talk to men.'</p>

<p>'Hm!' grumbled Fox-Moore. 'I never saw <i>you</i> at a loss.'</p>

<p>'You did last night.'</p>

<p>'No, I didn't. I saw you getting on like a house afire with
Haycroft and the beguiling Borrodaile. It's a pity all the decent
men are married.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox-Moore allowed her own coffee to get cold while she
hovered over the sacred rite of scientific tea-making. Mr. Fox-Moore,
talking to Vida about the Foreign Office reception, to
which they had all gone on after the Tunbridges' dinner, kept
watching with a kind of <a name="Page_36t" id="Page_36t"></a><a href="#Page_36tn">half-absent-minded</a> scorn his wife's fussily
punctilious pains to prepare the brew 'his way.' When all was
ready and the tea steaming on its way to him in the hands of its
harassed maker, he curtly declined it, got up, and left the room.
A moment after, the shutting of the front door announced the
beginning of yet another of the master's absences.</p>

<p>'How can you stand it?' said Vida, under her breath.</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't mind his going away,' said the other, dully.</p>

<p>'No; but his coming back!'</p>

<p>'One of the things I'm grateful to Donald for'&mdash;she spoke as
if there were plenty more&mdash;'he is very good to you, Vida.' And
in her tone there was criticism of the beneficiary.</p>

<p>'You mean, he's not as rude to me as he is to you?'</p>

<p>'He is even forbearing. And you&mdash;you rather frighten me
sometimes.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>'I see that.'</p>

<p>'It would be very terrible for <i>me</i> if he took it into his head not
to like you.'</p>

<p>'If he took it into his head to forbid your having me here, you
mean.'</p>

<p>'But even when you aren't polite he just laughs. Still, he's not
a patient man.'</p>

<p>'Do you think you have to tell me that?'</p>

<p>'No, dear, only to remind you not to try him too far. For my
sake, Vida, don't ever do that.'</p>

<p>She put out her yellow, parchment-like hand, and her sister
closed hers over it an instant.</p>

<p>'Here's the hot milk,' said Vida. 'Now we'll have some more
coffee.'</p>

<p>'Are you coming with me to-day?' Mrs. Fox-Moore asked quite
cheerfully for her as the servant shut the door.</p>

<p>'Oh, is this Friday? N&mdash;no.' The younger woman looked
at the chill grey world through the window, and followed up the
hesitating negative with a quite definite, 'I couldn't stand slums
to-day.' The two exchanged the look that means, 'Here we are
again up against this recurring difference.' But there was no ill-humour
in either face as their eyes met.</p>

<p>Between these two daughters of one father existed that sort of
haunting family resemblance often seen between two closely related
persons, despite one being attractive and the other in some way
repellent. The observer traces the same lines in each face, the
same intensification of 'the family look' in the smile, and yet
knows that the slight disparity in age fails to account for a difference
wide as the poles.</p>

<p>And not alone difference of taste, of environment and experience,
not these alone make up the sum of their unlikeness. You
had only to look from the fresh simplicity of white muslin blouse
and olive-coloured cloth in the one case, to the ungainly expensiveness
of the black silk gown of the married woman, in order to get
from the first a sense of dainty morning freshness, and from Mrs.
Fox-Moore not alone a lugubrious <i>memento mori</i> sort of impression,
but that more disquieting reminder of the ugly and over-elaborate
thing life is to many an estimable soul. Janet Fox-Moore had the
art of rubbing this dark fact in till, so to speak, the black came off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
She seemed to achieve it partly by dint of wearing (instead of any
relief of lace or even of linen at her throat) a hard band of that
passementerie secretly so despised of the little Tunbridges. This
device did not so much 'finish off' the neck of Mrs. Fox-Moore's
gowns, as allow the funereal dulness of them to overflow on to her
brown neck. It even cast an added shadow on her sallow cheek.
The figure of the older woman, gaunt and thin enough, announced
the further constriction of the corset. By way of revenge the sharp
shoulder-blades poked the corset out till it defined a ridge in the
black silk back. In front, too, the slab-like figure declined co-operation
with the corset, and withdrew, leaving a hiatus that the
silk bodice clothed though it did not conceal. You could not have
told whether the other woman wore that ancient invention for a
figure insufficient or over-exuberant. As you followed her movements,
easy with the ease of a child, while she walked or stooped
or caught up the fragile Doris, or raised her arm to take a book from
the shelf, you got an impression of a physique in perfect because
unconscious harmony with its environment. If, on the contrary,
you watched but so much as the nervous, uncertain hand of the
other woman, you would know here was one who had spent her
years in alternately grasping the nettle and letting it go&mdash;reaping
only stings in life's fair fields. Easy for any one seeing her in these
days (though she wasn't thirty-six) to share Mrs. Freddy's incredulous
astonishment at hearing from Haycroft the night before that
Janet Levering had been 'the beauty of her family.' Mrs.
Freddy's answer had been, 'Oh, don't make fun of her!' and
Haycroft had had to assure her of his seriousness, while the little
hostess still stared uncertain.</p>

<p>'The <i>lines</i> of her face are rather good,' she admitted. 'Oh, but
those yellow and pink eyes, and her general muddiness!'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' Sir William had agreed. 'She's changed so that I
would never have known her, but her colouring used to be her
strong point. I assure you she was magnificent&mdash;oh, much more
striking than the younger sister!'</p>

<p>The bloodless-looking woman who sat uneasily at her own
board clutching at a thin fragment of cold dry toast that hung
cheerlessly awry in the silver rack, like the last brown leaf to a
frosty tree, while she crunched the toast, spoke dryly of the poor;
of how 'interesting many of them are;' how when you take the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>trouble to understand them, you no longer lump them all together
in a featureless misery, you realize how significant and varied are
their lives.</p>

<p>'Not half as significant and varied as their smells,' said her
unchastened sister.</p>

<p>'Oh, you sometimes talk as if you had no heart!'</p>

<p>'The trouble is, I have no stomach. When you've lured me
into one of those dingy alleys and that all-pervading greasy smell
of poverty comes flooding into my face&mdash;well, simply all my most
uncharitable feelings rise up in revolt. I want to hold my nose
and hide my eyes, and call for the motor-car. Running away isn't
fast enough,' she said, with energy and a sudden spark in her
golden-brown eye.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox-Moore poised the fat silver jug over her own belated
cup, and waited for the thick cream to come out in a slow and
grudging gobbet with a heavy plump into the coffee. As she
waited, she gently rebuked that fastidiousness in her companion
that shrank from contact with the unsavoury and the unfortunate.</p>

<p>'It isn't only my fastidiousness, as you call it, that is offended,'
Vida retorted. 'I am penetrated by the hopelessness of what we're
doing. It salves my conscience, or <i>yours</i>&mdash;&mdash;' Hurriedly she
added, '&mdash;&mdash;that's not what you mean to do it for, I <i>know</i>, dear&mdash;and
you're an angel and I'm a mere cumberer of the earth. But
when I'm only just "cumbering," I feel less a fraud than when
I'm pretending to do good.'</p>

<p>'You needn't pretend.'</p>

<p>'I can't do anything else. To go among your poor makes me
feel in my heart that I'm simply flaunting my better fortune.'</p>

<p>'I never saw you flaunting it.'</p>

<p>'Well, I assure you it's when you've got me to go with you on
one of your Whitechapel raids that I feel most strongly how outrageous
it is that, in addition to all my other advantages, I should
buy self-approval by doing some tuppenny-ha'penny service to a
toiling, starving fellow-creature.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox-Moore set down her coffee-cup. 'You mustn't suppose&mdash;&mdash;'
she began.</p>

<p>'No, no,' Vida cut her short. 'I don't doubt <i>your</i> motives. I
know too well how ready you are to sacrifice yourself. But it does
fill me with a kind of rage to see some of those smug Settlement
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>workers, the people that plume themselves on leaving luxurious
homes. They don't say how hideously bored they were in them.
They are perfectly enchanted at the excitement and importance
they get out of going to live among the poor, who don't want
them&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, my dear Vida!'</p>

<p>'Not a little bit! Well, the <i>wily</i> paupers do, perhaps, for what
they can get out of our sort.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox-Moore cast down her eyes as though convicted by
the recollection of some concrete example.</p>

<p>'We're only scratching at the surface,' Vida, said&mdash;'such an
ugly surface, too! And the more we scratch, the uglier things
come to light.'</p>

<p>'You make too much of that disappointment at Christmas.'</p>

<p>'I wasn't even thinking of the hundredth time you've been disillusioned.'
Vida threw down her table napkin, and stood up.
'I was thinking of people like our young parson cousin.'</p>

<p>'George&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Vida made a shrug of half-impatient, half-humorous assent.
'Leaves the Bishop's Palace and comes to London. He, too,
wants "to live for the poor." Never for an instant one of them.
Always the patron&mdash;the person something may be got out of&mdash;or,
at all events, hoped from.'</p>

<p>She seemed to be about to leave the room, but as her sister
answered with some feeling, 'No, no, they love and respect him!'
Vida paused, and brought up by the fire that the sudden cold
made comforting.</p>

<p>'George is a different man since he's found his vocation,' Mrs.
Fox-Moore insisted. 'You read it in his face.'</p>

<p>'Oh, if all you mean is that <i>he's</i> happier, why not? He's able
to look on himself as a benefactor. He's tasting the intoxication
of the King among Beggars.'</p>

<p>'You are grossly unfair, Vida.'</p>

<p>'So he thinks when I challenge him: "What good, what earthly
good, is all this unless an anodyne&mdash;for you&mdash;is good?"'</p>

<p>'It seems to me a very real good that George Nuneaton and his
kind should go into the dark places and brighten hopeless lives
with a little Christian kindness&mdash;sometimes with a little timely
counsel.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' said the voice by the fire; 'and a little good music&mdash;don't
forget the good music.'</p>

<p>'An object-lesson in practical religion, isn't that something?'</p>

<p>'Practical! Good Heaven! A handful of complacent, expensively
educated young people playing at reform. The poor
wanting work, wanting decent housing&mdash;wanting <i>bread</i>&mdash;and
offered a little cultivated companionship.'</p>

<p>'Vida, what have you been reading?'</p>

<p>'Reading? I've been visiting George at his Settlement. I've
been intruding myself on the privacy of the poor once a week with
you&mdash;and I'm done with it! Personally I don't get enough out
of it to reconcile me to their getting so little.'</p>

<p>'You're burning,' observed the toneless voice from the head of
the table.</p>

<p>'Yes, I believe I was a little hot,' Vida laughed as she drew her
smoking skirt away from the fire. But she still stood close to the
cheerful blaze, one foot on the fender, the green cloth skirt drawn
up, leaving the more delicate fabric of her silk petticoat to meet the
fiery ordeal. 'If it annoys you to hear me say that's my view of
charity, why, don't make me talk about it;' but the face she turned
for an instant over her shoulder was far gentler than her words.
'And don't in future'&mdash;she was again looking down into the fire,
and she spoke slowly as one who delivers a reluctant ultimatum&mdash;'don't
ask me to help, except with money. <i>That</i> doesn't cost
so much.'</p>

<p>'I am disappointed.' Nothing further, but the sound of a chair
moved back, eloquent somehow of a discouragement deeper than
words conveyed.</p>

<p>Vida turned swiftly, and, coming back to her sister, laid an arm
about her shoulder.</p>

<p>'I'm a perfect monster! But you know, my dear, you rather
goaded me into saying all this by looking such a martyr when I've
tried to get out of going&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Very well, I won't ask you again.' But the toneless rejoinder
was innocent of rancour. Janet Fox-Moore gave the impression
of being too chilled, too drained of the generous life-forces, even
for anger.</p>

<p>'Besides,' said Vida, hurriedly, 'I'd nearly forgotten; there's
the final practising at eleven.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>'<i>I'd</i> forgotten your charity concert was so near!' As Mrs.
Fox-Moore gathered up her letters, she gave way for the first time
to a wintry little smile.</p>

<p>'The concert's mine, I admit, but the charity's the bishop's.
What absurd things we women fill up the holes in our lives with!'
Vida said, as she followed her sister into the hall. 'Do you know
the real reason I'm getting up this foolish concert?'</p>

<p>'Because you like singing, and do it so well that&mdash;yes, without
your looks and the indescribable "rest," you'd be a success. I
told you that, when I begged you to come and try London.'</p>

<p>'The reason I'm slaving over the concert&mdash;it isn't all musical
enthusiasm. It amuses me to organize it. All the ticklish, difficult,
"bothering" part of getting up a monster thing of this sort,
reconciling malcontents, enlisting the great operatic stars and not
losing the great social lights&mdash;it all interests me like a game.
I'm afraid the truth is I like managing things.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps Mrs. Freddy's not so far wrong.'</p>

<p>'Does Mrs. Freddy accuse me of being a "managing woman,"
horrid thought?'</p>

<p>'She was talking about you in her enthusiastic way when she
was here the other day. "Vida could administer a state," she
said. Yes, <i>I</i> laughed, too, but Mrs. Freddy shook her head quite
seriously, and said, "To think of a being like Vida&mdash;not even a
citizen."'</p>

<p>'I'm not a citizen?' exclaimed the lady, laughing down at her
sister over the banisters. 'Does she think because I've lived
abroad I've forfeited my rights of&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, all she means is&mdash;&mdash; Oh, you know the bee she's got in
her bonnet. She means, as she'll tell you, that "you have no
more voice in the affairs of England than if you were a Hottentot."'</p>

<p>'I can't say I've ever minded that. But it has an odd sound,
hasn't it&mdash;to hear one isn't a citizen.'</p>

<p>'Mrs. Freddy forgets&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I know! I know what you're going to say,' said the other,
light-heartedly. 'Mrs. Freddy forgets our unique ennobling influence;'
and the tall young woman laughed as she ran up the
last half of the long flight of stairs. At the top she halted a moment,
and called down to Mrs. Fox-Moore, who was examining
the cards left the day before, 'Speaking of our powerful influence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>over our men-folk&mdash;Mr. Freddy wasn't present, was he, when
she aired her views?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'I thought not. Her influence over Mr. Freddy is maintained
by the strictest silence on matters he isn't keen about.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>Seeing Ulland House for the first time on a fine afternoon in
early May against the jubilant green of its woodland hillside, the
beholder, a little dazzled in that first instant by the warmth of
colour burning in the ancient brick, might adapt the old dean's
line and call the coral-tinted structure rambling down the hillside,
'A rose-red dwelling half as old as Time.'</p>

<p>Its original architecture had been modified by the generations
as they passed. One lord of Ulland had expressed his fancy on
the eastern facade in gable and sculptured gargoyle; another his
fear or his defiance in the squat and sturdy tower with its cautious
slits in lieu of windows. Yet another Ulland had brought home
from eighteenth-century Italy a love of colonnades and terraced
gardens; and one still later had cut down to the level of the sward
the high ground-floor windows, so that where before had been two
doors or three, were now a dozen giving egress to the gardens.</p>

<p>The legend so often encountered in the history of old English
houses was not neglected here&mdash;that it had been a Crusader of
this family who had himself brought home from the Holy Land
the Lebanon cedar that spread wide its level branches on the west,
cutting the sunset into even bars. Tradition also said it was a
counsellor of Elizabeth who had set the dial on the lawn. Even
the latest lord had found a way to leave his impress upon the time.
He introduced 'Clock golf' at Ulland. From the upper windows
on the south and west the roving eye was caught by the great staring
face of this new timepiece on the turf&mdash;its Roman numerals showing
keen and white upon the vivid green. On the other side of
the cedar, that incorrigible Hedonist, the crumbling dial, told you
in Latin that he only marked the shining hours. But the brand
new clock on the lawn bore neither watchword nor device&mdash;seemed
even to have dropped its hands as though in modesty withheld
from pointing to hours so little worthy of record.</p>

<p>Two or three men, on this fine Saturday, had come down from
London for the week-end to disport themselves on the Ulland links,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>half a mile beyond the park. After a couple of raw days, the
afternoon had turned out quite unseasonably warm, and though
the golfers had come back earlier than usual, not because of the
heat but because one of their number had a train to catch, they
agreed it was distinctly reviving to find tea served out of doors.</p>

<p>Already Lady John was in her place on the pillared colonnade,
behind the urn. Already, too, one of her pair of pretty nieces was
at hand to play the skilful lieutenant. Hermione Heriot, tactful,
charming, twenty-five, was equally ready to hand bread and butter,
or, sitting quietly, to perform the greater service&mdash;that of
presenting the fresh-coloured, discreetly-smiling vision called 'the
typical English girl.' Miss Heriot fulfilled to a nicety the requirements
of those who are sensibly reassured by the spectacle of careful
conventionality allied to feminine charm&mdash;a pleasant conversability
that may be trusted to soothe and counted on never to
startle. Hermione would almost as soon have stood on her head
in Piccadilly as have said anything original, though to her private
consternation such perilous stuff had been known to harbour an
uneasy instant in her bosom. She carried such inconvenient cargo
as carefully hidden as a conspirator would a bomb under his cloak.
It had grown to be as necessary to her to agree with the views and
fashions of the majority as it was disquieting to her to see these
contravened, or even for a single hour ignored. From the crown
of her carefully dressed head to the tips of her pointed toes she
was engaged in testifying her assent to the prevailing note. Despite
all this to recommend her, she was not Lady John's favourite niece.
No doubt about Jean Dunbarton holding that honour; and, to
Hermione's credit, her own love for her cousin enabled her to
accept the situation with a creditable equability. Jean Dunbarton
was due now at any moment, she having already sent over her
luggage with her maid the short two miles from the Bishop's
Palace, where the girl had dined and slept the night before.</p>

<p>The rest of the Ulland House party were arriving by the next
train. As Miss Levering was understood to be one of those expected
it will be seen that a justified faith in the excellence of the
Ulland links had not made Lady John unmindful of the wisdom
of including among 'the week-enders' a nice assortment of pretty
women for the amusement of her golfers in the off hours.</p>

<p>Of this other young lady swinging her golf club as she came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>across the lawn with the men&mdash;sole petticoat among them&mdash;it
could not be pretended that any hostess, let alone one so worldly-wise
as Lady John Ulland, would look to have the above-hinted
high and delicate office performed by so upright and downright&mdash;not
to say so bony&mdash;a young woman, with face so like a horse, and
the stride of a grenadier. Under her short leather-bound skirt
the great brown-booted feet seemed shamelessly to court attention&mdash;as
it were out of malice to catch your eye, while deliberately
they trampled on the tenderest traditions clinging still about the
Weaker Sex.</p>

<p>Lady John held in her hand the top of the jade and silver tea-caddy.
Hermione, as well as her aunt, knew that this top held
four teaspoonsful of tea. Lady John filled it once, filled it twice,
and turned the contents out each time into the gaping pot. Then,
absent-mindedly, she paused, eyeing the approaching party,&mdash;that
genial silver-haired despot, her husband, walking with Lord
Borrodaile, the gawky girl between them, except when she paused
to practise a drive. The fourth person, a short, compactly knit
man, was lounging along several paces behind, but every now and
then energetically shouting out his share in the conversation. The
ground of Lady John's interest in the group seemed to consist in
a half-mechanical counting of noses. Her eyes came back to the
tea-table and she made a third addition to the jade and silver
measure.</p>

<p>'We shall be only six for the first brew,' prompted the girl at her
side.</p>

<p>'Paul Filey is mooning somewhere about the garden.'</p>

<p>'Oh!'</p>

<p>'Why do you say it like that?'</p>

<p>Hermione's eyes rested a moment on the golfer who was bringing
up the rear. He was younger than his rather set figure had at
a distance proclaimed him.</p>

<p>'I was only thinking Dick Farnborough can't abide Paul,' said
the girl.</p>

<p>'A typical product of the public school is hardly likely to appreciate
an undisciplined creature with a streak of genius in him like
Paul Filey.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I rather love him myself,' said the girl, lightly, 'only as
Sophia says he does talk rather rot at times.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>With her hand on the tea-urn, releasing a stream of boiling
water into the pot, Lady John glanced over the small thickset
angel that poised himself on one podgy foot upon the lid of the
urn.</p>

<p>'Sophia's too free with her tongue. It's a mistake. It frightens
people off.'</p>

<p>'Men, you mean?'</p>

<p>'Especially men.'</p>

<p>'I often think,' said the young woman, 'that men&mdash;all except
Paul&mdash;would be more shocked at Sophia&mdash;if&mdash;she wasn't who
she is.'</p>

<p>'No doubt,' agreed her aunt. 'Still I sympathize with her
parents. I don't see how they'll ever marry her. She might just
as well be Miss Jones&mdash;that girl&mdash;for all she makes of herself.'</p>

<p>'Yes; I've often thought so, too,' agreed Hermione, apparently
conscious that the very most was made of <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>'She hasn't even been taught to walk.' Lady John was still
watching the girl's approach.</p>

<p>'Yet she looks best out of doors,' said Hermione, firmly.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes! She comes into the drawing-room as if she were
crossing a ploughed field!'</p>

<p>'All the same,' said Hermione, under her breath, 'when she <i>is</i>
indoors I'd rather see her walking than sitting.'</p>

<p>'You mean the way she crosses her legs?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'But that, too&mdash;it seems like so many other things, a question
only of degree. Nobody objects to seeing a pair of neat ankles
crossed&mdash;it looks rather nice and early Victorian. Nowadays
lots of girls cross their knees&mdash;and nobody says anything. But
Sophia crosses her&mdash;well, her <i>thighs</i>.'</p>

<p>And the two women laughed understandingly.</p>

<p>A stranger might imagine that the reason for Lady Sophia's
presence in the party was that she, by common consent, played a
capital game of golf&mdash;'for a woman.' That fact, however, was
rather against her. For people who can play the beguiling game,
<i>want</i> to play it&mdash;and want to play it not merely now and then out
of public spirit to make up a foursome, but constantly and for pure
selfish love of it. Woman may, if she likes, take it as a compliment
to her sex that this proclivity&mdash;held to be wholly natural in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>man&mdash;is called 'rather unfeminine' in a woman. But it was a
defect like the rest, forgiven the Lady Sophia for her father's sake.
Lord Borrodaile, held to be one of the most delightful of men, was
much in request for parties of this description. One reason for
his daughter's being there was that it glossed the fact that Lady
Borrodaile was not&mdash;was, indeed, seldom present, and one may
say never missed, in the houses frequented by her husband.</p>

<p>But as he and his friends not only did not belong to, but looked
down upon, the ultra smart set, where the larger freedoms are
practised in lieu of the lesser decencies, Lord Borrodaile lived his
life as far removed from any touch of scandal and irregularity as
the most puritanic of the bourgeoisie. Part and parcel of his
fastidiousness, some said&mdash;others, that from his Eton days he
had always been a lazy beggar. As though to show that he did
not shrink from reasonable responsibility towards his female impedimenta,
any inquiry as to the absence of Lady Borrodaile was
met by reference to Sophia. In short, where other attractive husbands
brought a boring wife, Lord Borrodaile brought an undecorative
daughter. While to the onlooker nearly every aspect of this
particular young woman would seem destined to offend a beauty-loving,
critical taste like that of Borrodaile, he was probably served,
as other mortals are, by that philosophy of the senses which brings
in time a deafness and a blindness to the unloveliness that we needs
must live beside. Lord Borrodaile was far too intelligent not to
see, too, that when people had got over Lady Sophia's uncompromising
exterior, they found things in her to admire as well as
to stand a little in awe of. Unlike one another as the Borrodailes
were, in one respect they presented to the world an undivided
front. From their point of view, just as laws existed to keep other
people in order, so was 'fashion' an affair for the middle classes.
The Borrodailes might dress as dowdily as they pleased, might
speak as uncompromisingly as they felt inclined. Were they not
Borrodailes of Borrodaile? Though open expression of this spirit
grows less common, they would not have denied that it is still the
prevailing temper of the older aristocracy. And so it has hitherto
been true that among its women you find that sort of freedom
which is the prerogative of those called the highest and of those
called the lowest. It is the women of all the grades between these
two extremes who have dared not to be themselves, who ape the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>manners, echo the catchwords, and garb themselves in the elaborate
ugliness, devised for the blind meek millions.</p>

<p>As the Lady Sophia, now a little in advance of her companions,
came stalking towards the steps, out from a little path that wound
among the thick-growing laurels issued Paul Filey. He raised his
eyes, and hurriedly thrust a small book into his pocket. The
young lady paused, but only apparently to pat, or rather to administer
an approving cuff to, the Bedlington terrier lying near the
lower step.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said over her shoulder to Filey, 'our side gave a good
account of itself that last round.'</p>

<p>'I was sure it would as soon as my malign influence was removed.'</p>

<p>'Yes; from the moment I took on Dick Farnborough, the situation
assumed a new aspect. You'll <i>never</i> play a good game, you
know, if you go quoting Baudelaire on the links.'</p>

<p>'Poor Paul!' his hostess murmured to her niece, 'I always
tremble when I see him exposed to Sophia's ruthless handling.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' whispered Hermione. 'She says she's sure he thinks of
himself as a prose Shelley; and for some reason that infuriates
Sophia.'</p>

<p>With a somewhat forced air of amusement, Mr. Filey was
following his critic up the steps, she still mocking at his 'drives'
and the way he negotiated his bunkers.</p>

<p>Arrived at the top of the little terrace, whose close-shorn turf
was level with the flagged floor of the colonnade, Mr. Filey sought
refuge near Hermione, as the storm-tossed barque, fleeing before
the wind, hies swift to the nearest haven.</p>

<p>Bending over the Bedlington, the Amazon remained on the top
step, her long, rather good figure garbed in stuff which Filey had
said was fit only for horse-blankets, but which was Harris tweed
slackly belted by a broad canvas girdle drawn through a buckle
of steel.</p>

<p>'<i>Will</i> you tell me,' he moaned in Hermione's ear, 'why the
daughter of a hundred earls has the manners of a groom, and
dresses herself in odds and ends of the harness room?'</p>

<p>'Sh! Somebody told her once you'd said something of that
sort.'</p>

<p>'No!' he said. 'Who?'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>'It wasn't I.'</p>

<p>'Of course not. But did she mind? What did she say, eh?'</p>

<p>'She only said, "He got that out of a novel of Miss Broughton's."'</p>

<p>Filey looked a little dashed. 'No! Has Miss Broughton said
it, too? Then there are more of them!' He glanced again at the
Amazon. 'Horrible thought!'</p>

<p>'Don't be so unreasonable. She couldn't play golf in a long
skirt and high heels!'</p>

<p>'Who <i>wants</i> a woman to play golf?'</p>

<p>Hermione gave him his tea with a smile. She knew with an
absolute precision just how perfectly at that moment she herself
was presenting the average man's picture of the ideal type of
reposeful womanhood.</p>

<p>As Lord John and the two other men, his companions, came up
the steps in the midst of a discussion&mdash;</p>

<p>'If you stop to argue, Mr. Farnborough,' said Lady John, holding
out a cup, 'you won't have time for tea before you catch that
train.'</p>

<p>'Oh, thank you!' He hastened to relieve her, while Hermione
murmured regrets that he wasn't staying. 'Lady John didn't ask
me,' he confided. As he saw in Hermione's face a project to intercede
for him, he added, 'And now I've promised my mother&mdash;we've got a lot
of people coming, and two men short!'</p>

<p>'Two men short! how horrible for her!' She said it half laughing,
but her view of the reality of the dilemma was apparent in her
letting the subject drop.</p>

<p>Farnborough, standing there tea-cup in hand, joined again in
the discussion that was going on about some unnamed politician
of the day, with whose character and destiny the future of England
might quite conceivably be involved.</p>

<p>Before a great while this unnamed person would be succeeding
his ailing and childless brother. There were lamentations in prospect
of his too early translation to the Upper House.</p>

<p>The older men had been speaking of his family, in which the
tradition of public service, generations old, had been revived in the
person of this younger son.</p>

<p>'I have never understood,' Lord John was saying, 'how a man
with such opportunities hasn't done more.'</p>

<p>'A man as able, too,' said Borrodaile, lazily. 'Think of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>tribute he wrung out of Gladstone at the very beginning of his
career. Whatever we may think of the old fox, Gladstone had
an eye for men.'</p>

<p>'Be <i>quiet</i>, will you!' Lady Sophia administered a little whack
to the Bedlington. 'Sh! Joey! don't you hear they're talking
about our cousin?'</p>

<p>'Who?' said Filey, bending over the lady with a peace-offering
of cake.</p>

<p>'Why, Geoffrey Stonor,' answered Sophia.</p>

<p>'<i>Is</i> it Stonor they mean?'</p>

<p>'Well, of course.'</p>

<p>'How do you know?' demanded Filey, in the pause.</p>

<p>'Oh, wherever there are two or three gathered together talking
politics and "the coming man"&mdash;who has such a frightful lot in
him that very little ever comes out&mdash;it's sure to be Geoffrey
Stonor they mean, isn't it, Joey?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps,' said her father, dryly, 'you'll just mention that to
him at dinner to-night.'</p>

<p>'<i>What!</i>' said Farnborough, with a keen look in his eyes. 'You
don't mean he's coming here!'</p>

<p>Sophia, too, had looked round at her host with frank interest.</p>

<p>'Comin' to play golf?'</p>

<p>'Well, he mayn't get here in time for a round to-night, but we're
rather expecting him by this four-thirty.'</p>

<p>'What fun!' Lady Sophia's long face had brightened.</p>

<p>'May I stay over till the next train?' Farnborough was whispering
to Lady John as he went round to her on the pretext of more
cream. 'Thank you&mdash;then I won't go till the six forty-two.'</p>

<p>'I didn't know,' Lady Sophia was observing in her somewhat
crude way, 'that you knew Geoffrey as well as all that.'</p>

<p>'We don't,' said Lord John. 'He's been saying for years he
wanted to come down and try our links, but it's by a fluke that he's
coming, after all.'</p>

<p>'He never comes to see <i>us</i>. He's far too busy, ain't he, Joey,
even if we can't see that he accomplishes much?'</p>

<p>'Give him time and you'll see!' said Farnborough, with a wag
of his head.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Lord John, 'he's still a young man. Barely forty.'</p>

<p>'Barely forty! <i>They</i> believe in prolonging their youth, don't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>they?' said Lady Sophia to no one in particular, and with her
mouth rather more full of cake than custom prescribes. 'Good
thing it isn't us, ain't it, Joey?'</p>

<p>'For a politician forty <i>is</i> young,' said Farnborough.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't I know it!' she retorted. 'I was reading the life
of Randolph Churchill the other day, and I came across a paragraph
of filial admiration about the hold Lord Randolph had contrived
to get so early in life over the House of Commons. It
occurred to me to wonder just how much of a boy Lord Randolph
was at the time. I was going to count up when I was saved the
trouble by coming to a sentence that said he was then "an unproved
stripling of thirty-two." You shouldn't laugh. It wasn't meant
sarcastic.'</p>

<p>'Unless you're leader of the Opposition, I suppose it's not very
easy to do much while your party's out of power,' hazarded Lady
John, 'is it?'</p>

<p>'One of the most interesting things about our coming back will
be to watch Stonor,' said Farnborough.</p>

<p>'After all, they said he did very well with his Under Secretaryship
under the last Government, didn't they?' Again Lady John
appealed to the two elder men.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' said Borrodaile. 'Oh, yes.'</p>

<p>'And the way'&mdash;Farnborough made up for any lack of enthusiasm&mdash;'the
way he handled that Balkan question!'</p>

<p>'All that was pure routine,' Lord John waved it aside. 'But
if Stonor had ever looked upon politics as more than a game, he'd
have been a power long before this.'</p>

<p>'Ah,' said Borrodaile, slowly, 'you go as far as that? I doubt
myself if he has enough of the demagogue in him.'</p>

<p>'But that's just why. The English people are not like the
Americans or the French. The English have a natural distrust of
the demagogue. I tell you if Stonor once believed in anything
with might and main, he'd be a leader of men.'</p>

<p>'Here he is now.'</p>

<p>Farnborough was the first to distinguish the sound of carriage
wheels behind the shrubberies. The others looked up and listened.
Yes, the crunch of gravel. The wall of laurel was too thick to give
any glimpse from this side of the drive that wound round to the
main entrance. But some animating vision nevertheless seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>miraculously to have penetrated the dense green wall, to the
obvious enlivenment of the company.</p>

<p>'It's rather exciting seeing him at close quarters,' Hermione said
to Filey.</p>

<p>'Yes! He's the only politician I can get up any real enthusiasm
for. He's so many-sided. I saw him yesterday at a Bond Street
show looking at caricatures of himself and all his dearest friends.'</p>

<p>'Really. How did he take the sacrilege?'</p>

<p>'Oh, he was immensely amused at the fellow's impudence.
You see, Stonor could understand the art of the thing as well as
the fun&mdash;the fierce economy of line&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Nobody listened. There were other attempts at conversation,
mere decent pretence at not being absorbed in watching for the
appearance of Geoffrey Stonor.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>There was the faint sound of a distant door's opening, and there
was a glimpse of the old butler. But before he could reach the
French window with his announcement, his own colourless presence
was masked, wiped out&mdash;not as the company had expected by
the apparition of a man, but by a tall, lightly-moving young woman
with golden-brown eyes, and wearing a golden-brown gown that
had touches of wallflower red and gold on the short jacket. There
were only wallflowers in the small leaf-green toque, and except for
the sable boa in her hand (which so suddenly it was too warm to
wear) no single thing about her could at all adequately account for
the air of what, for lack of a better term, may be called accessory
elegance that pervaded the golden-brown vision, taking the low
sunlight on her face and smiling as she stepped through the
window.</p>

<p>It was no small tribute to the lady had she but known it, that her
coming was not received nor even felt as an anti-climax.</p>

<p>As she came forward, all about her rose a significant Babel:
'Here's Miss Levering!' 'It's Vida!' 'Oh, how do you <i>do</i>!'&mdash;the
frou-frou of swishing skirts, the scrape of chairs pushed back
over stone flags, and the greeting of the host and hostess, cordial
to the point of affection&mdash;the various handshakings, the discreet
winding through the groups of a footman with a fresh teapot, the
Bedlington's first attack of barking merged in tail-wagging upon
pleased recognition of a friend; and a final settling down again
about the tea-table with the air full of scraps of talk and unfinished
questions.</p>

<p>'You didn't see anything of my brother and his wife?' asked
Lord Borrodaile.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' his host suddenly remembered. 'I thought the
Freddys were coming by that four-thirty as well as&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;nobody but me.' She threw her many-tailed boa on
the back of the chair that Paul Filey had drawn up for her between
the hostess and the place where Borrodaile had been sitting.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>'There are two more good trains before dinner&mdash;&mdash;' began
Lord John.</p>

<p>'Oh, didn't I tell you,' said his wife, as she gave the cup just
filled for the new-comer into the nearest of the outstretched hands&mdash;'didn't
I tell you I had a note from Mrs. Freddy by the afternoon
post? They aren't coming.'</p>

<p>Out of a little chorus of regret, came Borrodaile's slightly mocking,
'Anything wrong with the precious children?'</p>

<p>'She didn't mention the children&mdash;nor much of anything else&mdash;just
a hurried line.'</p>

<p>'The children were as merry as grigs yesterday,' said Vida,
looking at their uncle across the table. 'I went on to the Freddys'
after the Royal Academy. No!' she put her cup down suddenly.
'Nobody is to ask me how I like my own picture! The Tunbridge
children&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That thing Hoyle has done of you,' said Lord Borrodaile,
deliberately, 'is a very brilliant and a very misleading performance.'</p>

<p>'Thank you.'</p>

<p>Filey and Lord John, in spite of her interdiction, were pursuing
the subject of the much-discussed portrait.</p>

<p>'It certainly is one aspect of you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Don't you think his Velasquez-like use of black and white&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The tiny Tunbridges, as I was saying,' she went on imperturbably,
'were having a teafight when I got there. I say "fight"
advisedly.'</p>

<p>'Then I'll warrant,' said their uncle, 'that Sara was the aggressor.'</p>

<p>'She was.'</p>

<p>'You saw Mrs. Freddy?' asked Lady John, with an interest
half amused, half cynical, in her eyes.</p>

<p>'For a moment.'</p>

<p>'She doesn't confess it, I suppose,' the hostess went on, 'but I
imagine she is rather perturbed;' and Lady John glanced at
Borrodaile with her good-humoured, worldly-wise smile.</p>

<p>'Poor Mrs. Freddy!' said Vida. 'You see, she's taken it all
quite seriously&mdash;this Suffrage nonsense.'</p>

<p>'Yes;' Mrs. Freddy's brother-in-law had met Lady John's
look with the same significant smile as that lady's own&mdash;'Yes,
she's naturally feeling rather crestfallen&mdash;perhaps she'll <i>see</i> now!'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>'Mrs. Freddy crestfallen, what about?' said Farnborough.
But he was much preoccupied at that moment in supplying Lady
Sophia with bits of toast the exact size for balancing on the Bedlington's
nose. For the benefit of his end of the table Paul Filey
had begun to describe the new one-man show of caricatures of
famous people just opened in Bond Street. The 'mordant genius,'
as he called it, of this new man&mdash;an American Jew&mdash;offered an
irresistible opportunity for phrase-making. And still on the other
side of the tea urn the Ullands were discussing with Borrodaile
and Miss Levering the absent lady whose 'case' was obviously a
matter of concern to her friends.</p>

<p>'Well, let us hope,' Lord John was saying as sternly as his
urbanity permitted&mdash;'let us hope this exhibition in the House
will be a lesson to her.'</p>

<p>'<i>She</i> wasn't concerned in it!' Vida quickly defended her.</p>

<p>'Nevertheless we are all hoping,' said Lady John, 'that it has
come just in time to prevent her from going over the edge.'</p>

<p>'Over the edge!' Farnborough pricked up his ears at last in
good earnest, feeling that the conversation on the other side had
grown too interesting for him to be out of it any longer. 'Over
what edge?'</p>

<p>'The edge of the Woman Suffrage precipice,' said Lady John.</p>

<p>'You call it a precipice?' Vida Levering raised her dark brows
in a little smile.</p>

<p>'Don't you?' demanded her hostess.</p>

<p>'I should say mud-puddle.'</p>

<p>'From the point of view of the artist'&mdash;Paul Filey had begun
laying down some new law, but turning an abrupt corner, he followed
the wandering attention of his audience&mdash;'from the point
of view of the artist,' he repeated, 'it would be interesting to know
what the phenomenon is, that Lady John took for a precipice and
that Miss Levering says is a mud-puddle.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said Lord John, thinking it well to generalize and spare
Mrs. Freddy further rending, 'we've been talking about this public
demonstration of the unfitness of women for public affairs.'</p>

<p>'Give me some more toast dice!' Sophia said to Farnborough.
'You haven't seen Joey's new accomplishment. They're only
discussing that idiotic scene the women made the other night.'</p>

<p>'Oh, in the gallery of the House of Commons?'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes, wasn't it disgustin'?' said Paul Filey, facing about suddenly
with an air of cheerful surprise at having at last hit on something
that he and Lady Sophia could heartily agree about.</p>

<p>'Perfectly revolting!' said Hermione Heriot, not to be out of it.
For it is well known that, next to a great enthusiasm shared, nothing
so draws human creatures together as a good bout of cursing
in common. So with emphasis Miss Heriot repeated, 'Perfectly
revolting!'</p>

<p>Her reward was to see Paul turn away from Sophia and say, in a
tone whose fervour might be called marked&mdash;</p>

<p>'I'm glad to hear you say so!'</p>

<p>She consolidated her position by asking sweetly, 'Does it need
saying?'</p>

<p>'Not by people like you. But it <i>does</i> need saying when it comes
to people we know&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Like Mrs. Freddy. Yes.'</p>

<p>That unfortunate little lady seemed to be 'getting it' on all sides.
Even her brother-in-law, who was known to be in reality a great
ally of hers&mdash;even Lord Borrodaile was chuckling as though at
some reflection distinctly diverting.</p>

<p>'Poor Laura! She was being unmercifully chaffed about it last
night.'</p>

<p>'I don't myself consider it any longer a subject for chaff,' said
Lord John.</p>

<p>'No,' agreed his wife; '<i>I</i> felt that before this last outbreak. At
the time of the first disturbance&mdash;where was it?&mdash;in some town
in the North several weeks ago&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Vida Levering; 'I almost think that was even
worse!'</p>

<p>'Conceive the sublime impertinence,' said Lady John, 'of an
ignorant little factory girl presuming to stand up in public and
interrupt a speech by a minister of the Crown!'</p>

<p>'I don't know what we're coming to, I'm sure!' said Borrodaile,
with a detached air.</p>

<p>'Oh, <i>that</i> girl&mdash;beyond a doubt,' said his host, with conviction&mdash;'that
girl was touched.'</p>

<p>'Oh, beyond a doubt!' echoed Mr. Farnborough.</p>

<p>'There's something about this particular form of feminine
folly&mdash;&mdash;' began Lord John.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>But he wasn't listened to&mdash;for several people were talking at
once.</p>

<p>After receiving a few preliminary kicks, the subject had fallen,
as a football might, plump into the very midst of a group of school-boys.
Its sudden presence there stirred even the sluggish to unwonted
feats. Every one must have his kick at this Suffrage Ball,
and manners were for the nonce in abeyance.</p>

<p>In the midst of an obscuring dust of discussion, floated fragments
of condemnation: 'Sexless creatures!' 'The Shrieking Sisterhood!'
etc., in which the kindest phrase was Lord John's repeated,
'Touched, you know,' as he tapped his forehead&mdash;'not really
responsible, poor wretches. Touched.'</p>

<p>'Still, everybody doesn't know that. It must give men a quite
horrid idea of women,' said Hermione, delicately.</p>

<p>'No'&mdash;Lord Borrodaile spoke with a wise forbearance&mdash;'we
don't confound a handful of half-insane females with the whole
sex.'</p>

<p>Dick Farnborough was in the middle of a spirited account of
that earlier outbreak in the North&mdash;</p>

<p>'She was yelling like a Red Indian, and the policeman carried
her out scratching and spitting&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ugh!' Hermione exchanged looks of horror with Paul Filey.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' said Lady John, with disgust, 'we saw all that in the
papers.'</p>

<p>Miss Levering, too, had turned her face away&mdash;not as Hermione
did, to summon a witness to her detestation, but rather as
one avoiding the eyes of the men.</p>

<p>'You see,' said Farnborough, with gusto, 'there's something
about women's clothes&mdash;<i>especially</i> their hats, you know&mdash;they&mdash;well,
they ain't built for battle.'</p>

<p>'They ought to wear deer-stalkers,' was Lady Sophia's contribution
to the New Movement.</p>

<p>'It is quite true,' Lady John agreed, 'that a woman in a scrimmage
can never be a heroic figure.'</p>

<p>'No, that's just it,' said Farnborough. 'She's just funny, don't
you know!'</p>

<p>'I don't agree with you about the fun,' Borrodaile objected.
'That's why I'm glad they've had their lesson. I should say
there was almost nothing more degrading than this public spectacle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>of&mdash;&mdash;' Borrodaile lifted his high shoulders higher still, with an
effect of intense discomfort. 'It never but once came my way that
I remember, but I'm free to own,' he said, 'there's nothing that
shakes my nerves like seeing a woman struggling and kicking in a
policeman's arms.'</p>

<p>But Farnborough was not to be dissuaded from seeing humour
in the situation.</p>

<p>'They say they swept up a peck of hairpins after the battle!'</p>

<p>As though she had had as much of the subject as she could very
well stand, Miss Levering leaned sideways, put an arm behind her,
and took possession of her boa.</p>

<p>'They're just ending the first act of <i>Siegfried</i>. How glad I am
to be in your garden instead of Covent Garden!'</p>

<p>Ordinarily there would have been a movement to take the
appreciative guest for a stroll.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was only chance, or the enervating heat, that kept
the company in their chairs listening to Farnborough&mdash;</p>

<p>'The cattiest one of the two, there she stood like this, her clothes
half torn off, her hair down her back, her face the colour of a
lobster and the crowd jeering at her&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I don't see how you could stand and look on at such a hideous
scene,' said Miss Levering.</p>

<p>'Oh&mdash;I&mdash;I didn't! I'm only telling you how Wilkinson
described it. He said&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'How did Major Wilkinson happen to be there?' asked Lady
John.</p>

<p>'He'd motored over from Headquarters to move a vote of thanks
to the chairman. He said he'd seen some revolting things in his
time, but the scrimmage of the stewards and the police with those
women&mdash;&mdash;!' Farnborough ended with an expressive gesture.</p>

<p>'If it was as horrible as that for Major Wilkinson to look on
at&mdash;what must it have been for those girls?' It was Miss Levering
speaking. She seemed to have abandoned the hope of being
taken for a stroll, and was leaning forward, chin in hand, looking
at the fringe of the teacloth.</p>

<p>Richard Farnborough glanced at her as if he resented the note
of wondering pity in the low tone.</p>

<p>'It's never so bad for the lunatic,' he said, 'as for the sane people
looking on.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh, I don't suppose <i>they</i> mind,' said Hermione&mdash;'women like
<i>that</i>.'</p>

<p>'It's flattery to call them women. They're sexless monstrosities,'
said Paul Filey.</p>

<p>'You know some of them?' Vida raised her head.</p>

<p>'<i>I?</i>' Filey's face was nothing less than aghast at the mere
suggestion.</p>

<p>'But you've seen them&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Heaven forbid!'</p>

<p>'But I suppose you've gone and listened to them haranguing
the crowds.'</p>

<p>'Now <i>do</i> I look like a person who&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well, you see we're all so certain they're such abominations,'
said Vida, 'I thought maybe some of us knew something about
them.'</p>

<p>Dick Farnborough was heard saying to Lord John in a tone of
cheerful vigour&mdash;</p>

<p>'Locking up is too good for 'em. I'd give 'em a good thrashin'.'</p>

<p>'Spirited fellow!' said Miss Levering, promptly, with an accent
that brought down a laugh on the young gentleman's head.</p>

<p>He joined in it, but with a <i>na&iuml;f</i> uneasiness. What's the matter
with the woman?&mdash;his vaguely bewildered face seemed to inquire.
After all, I'm only agreeing with her.</p>

<p>'Few of us have time, I imagine,' said Filey, 'to go and listen
to their ravings.'</p>

<p>As Filey was quite the idlest of men, without the preoccupation
of being a tolerable sportsman or even a player of games, Miss
Levering's little laugh was echoed by others beside Lady Sophia.</p>

<p>'At all events,' said Vida to Lord Borrodaile, as she stood up,
and he drew her chair out of her way, 'even if we don't know much
about these women, we've spent a happy hour denouncing them.'</p>

<p>'Who's going to have a short round before sundown?' said
Lady Sophia, getting up briskly. '<i>You</i>, of course, Mr. Filey.
Or are you too "busy"?'</p>

<p>'Say too thirsty. May I?' He carried his cup round to Lady
John, not seeming to see Hermione's hospitable hand held out
for it.</p>

<p>In the general shuffle Farnborough found himself carried off by
Sophia and Lord John.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>'Who is our fourth?' said Lady Sophia, suddenly.</p>

<p>'Oh, Borrodaile!' Lord John stopped halfway across the lawn
and called back, 'aren't you coming?'</p>

<p>'It's not a bit of use,' said Sophia. 'You'll see. He's safe to
sit there and talk to Miss Levering till the dressing-bell rings.'</p>

<p>'Isn't she a <i>nice</i> creature!' said Lord John. 'I can't think how
a woman like that hasn't got some nice fella to marry her!'</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>'Would you like to see my yellow garden, Vida?' Lady John
asked. 'It's rather glorious at this moment.'</p>

<p>Obvious from the quick lifting of the eyes that the guest was on
the point of welcoming the proposal, had Filey not swallowed his
belated cup of tea with surprising quickness after saying, 'What's
a yellow garden?' in the unmistakable tone of one bent upon
enlarging his experience. Lady John, with all her antenn&aelig; out,
lost no time in saying to Vida&mdash;</p>

<p>'Perhaps you're a little tired. Hermione, you show Mr. Filey
the garden. And maybe, Lord Borrodaile would like to see it, too.'</p>

<p>Although the last-named failed to share the enthusiasm expected
in a gardener, he pulled his long, slackly-put-together figure out of
the chair and joined the young people.</p>

<p>When they were out of earshot, 'What's the matter?' asked
Lady John.</p>

<p>'Matter?'</p>

<p>'Yes, what did poor Paul say to make you fall upon him like
that?'</p>

<p>'I didn't "fall upon" him, did I?'</p>

<p>'Well, yes, I rather thought you did.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I suppose I&mdash;perhaps it did jar on me, just a little, to
hear a cocksure boy&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'He's not a boy. Paul is over thirty.'</p>

<p>'I was thinking of Dick Farnborough, too&mdash;talking about
women like that, before women.'</p>

<p>'Oh, all they meant was&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know. Of course we <i>all</i> know they aren't accustomed
to treating our sex in general with overmuch respect when there
are only men present&mdash;but&mdash;do you think it's quite decent that
they should be so free with their contempt of women before us?'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>'But, my dear Vida! <i>That</i> sort of woman! Haven't they
deserved it?'</p>

<p>'That's just what nobody seems to know. I've sat and listened
to conversations like the one at tea for a week now, and I've said
as much against those women as anybody. Only to-day, somehow,
when I heard that boy&mdash;yes, I was conscious I didn't
like it.'</p>

<p>'You're behaving exactly as Dr. Johnson did about Garrick.
You won't allow any one to abuse those women but yourself.'</p>

<p>Lady John cleared the whole trivial business away with a laugh.</p>

<p>'Now, be nice to Paul. He's dying to talk to you about his
book. Let us go and join them in the garden. See if you can
stand before my yellow blaze and not feel melted.'</p>

<p>The elder woman and the younger went down the terrace
through a little copse to her ladyship's own area of experimentation.
A gate of old Florentine scrolled iron opened suddenly upon
a blaze of yellow in all the shades from the orange velvet of the
wallflower through the shaded saffron of azalias and a dozen tints
of tulip to the palest primrose and jonquil.</p>

<p>The others were walking round the enclosing grass paths that
served as broad green border, and Filey, who had been in all sorts
of queer places, said the yellow garden made him think of a Mexican
serap&eacute;&mdash;'one of those silk scarves, you know&mdash;native weaving
made out of the pineapple fibre.'</p>

<p>But Vida only said, 'Yes. It's a good scheme of colour.'</p>

<p>She sat on the rustic seat while Lady John explained to Lord
Borrodaile, whose gardens were renowned, how she and Simonson
treated this and that plant to get so fine a result. Filey had lost no
time in finding a place for himself by Miss Levering, while Hermione
trailed dutifully round the garden with the others. Occasionally
she looked over her shoulder at the two on the seat by
the sunken wall&mdash;Vida leaning back in the corner motionless,
absolutely inexpressive; Filey's eager face bent forward. He was
moving his hands in a way he had learned abroad.</p>

<p>'You were rather annoyed with me,' he was saying. 'I saw
that.'</p>

<p>The lady did not deny the imputation.</p>

<p>'But you oughtn't to be. Because you see it's only because my
ideal of woman is'&mdash;again that motion of the hands&mdash;'<i>what</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
it is, that when I see her stepping down from her pedestal I&mdash;&mdash;'
the hands indicated consternation, followed hard by cataclysmic
ruin. 'Of course, lots of men don't care. I <i>do</i>. I care enormously,
and so you must forgive me. Won't you?' He bent
nearer.</p>

<p>'Oh, <i>I've</i> nothing to forgive.'</p>

<p>'I know without your telling me, I feel instinctively, <i>you</i> more
than most people&mdash;you'd simply loathe the sort of thing we were
talking about at tea&mdash;women yelling and fighting men&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;yes, don't go all over that.'</p>

<p>'No, of course I won't,' he said soothingly. 'I can feel it to
my very spine, how you shrink from such horrors.'</p>

<p>Miss Levering, raising her eyes suddenly, caught the look Hermione
cast backward as Lady John halted her party a moment
near the pansy-strip in the gorgeous yellow carpet spread out
before them.</p>

<p>'Don't you want to sit down?' Vida called out to the girl,
drawing aside her gown.</p>

<p>'What?' said Hermione, though she had heard quite well.
Slowly she retraced her steps down the grass path as if to have
the words repeated.</p>

<p>But if Miss Levering's idea had been to change the conversation,
she was disappointed. There was nothing Paul Filey liked better
than an audience, and he had already the impression that Miss
Heriot was what he would have scorned to call anything but
'simpatica.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure you've shown the new garden to dozens already,' Miss
Levering said to the niece of the house. 'Sit down and confess
you've had enough of it!'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't think,' began Hermione, suavely, 'that one ever
gets too much of a thing like that!'</p>

<p>'There! I'm glad to hear you say so. How can we have too
much beauty!' exclaimed Filey, receiving the new occupant of
the seat as a soul worthy of high fellowship. Then he leaned
across Miss Heriot and said to the lady in the corner, 'I'm making
that the theme of my book.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I heard you were writing something.'</p>

<p>'Yes, a sort of plea for the &aelig;sthetic basis of society! It's the
only cure for the horrors of modern civilization&mdash;for the very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>thing we were talking about at tea! What is it but a loss of the
sense of beauty that's to blame?' Elbows on knees, he leaned so
far forward that he could see both faces, and yet his own betrayed
the eye turned inward&mdash;the face of the one who quotes. The
ladies knew that he was obliging them with a memorized extract
from 'A Plea for the &AElig;sthetic Basis.' 'Nothing worse can happen
to the world than loss of its sense of Beauty. Men, high and low
alike, cling to it still as incarnated in women.' (Hermione crossed
her pointed toes and lowered her long eyelashes.) 'We have made
Woman the object of our deepest adoration! We have set her
high on a throne of gold. We have searched through the world
for jewels to crown her. We have built millions of temples to our
ideal of womanhood and called them homes. We have fought
and wrought and sung for her&mdash;and all we ask in return is that
she should tend the sacred fire, so that the light of Beauty might
not die out of the world.' He was not ill-pleased with his period.
'But women'&mdash;he leaned back, and illustrated with the pliant
white hands that were ornamented with outlandish rings&mdash;'women
are not content with their high and holy office.'</p>

<p>'<i>Some</i> women,' amended Hermione, softly.</p>

<p>'There are more and more every day who are not content,' he
said sternly; then, for an instant unbending and craning a little
forward, 'Of course I don't mean you&mdash;<i>you</i> are exceptions&mdash;but
of women in the mass! Look at them! They force their way
into men's work, they crowd into the universities&mdash;yes, yes' (in
vain Hermione tried to reassure him by 'exceptions')&mdash;'Beauty
is nothing to them! They fling aside their delicate, provocative
draperies, they cast off their scented sandals. They pull on brown
boots and bicycling skirts! They put man's yoke of hard linen
round their ivory throats, and they scramble off their jewelled
thrones to mount the rostrum and the omnibus!'</p>

<p>'Why? <i>Why</i> do they?' Vida demanded, laughing. 'Nobody
ever tells me why. I can't believe they're as unselfish as <i>you</i>
make out.'</p>

<p>'I!'</p>

<p>'You ought to admire them if they voluntarily give up all those
beautiful things&mdash;knowing beforehand they'll only win men's
scorn. For you've always warned them!'</p>

<p>He didn't even hear. 'Ah, Ladies, Ladies!' half laughing, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>really very much in earnest, he apostrophized the peccant sex, 'I
should like to ask, are we men to look upon our homes as dusty
din-filled camps on the field of battle, or as holy temples of Peace?
Ah!' He leaned back in his corner, stretched out his long legs,
and thrust his restless hands in his pockets. 'If they knew!'</p>

<p>'Women?' asked Hermione, with the air of one painstakingly
brushing up crumbs of wisdom.</p>

<p>Paul Filey nodded.</p>

<p>'Knew&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'They would see that in the ugly scramble they had let fall their
crowns! If they only knew,' he repeated, 'they would go back to
their thrones, and, with the sceptre of beauty in one hand and the
orb of purity in the other, they would teach men to worship them
again.'</p>

<p>'And then?' said Miss Levering.</p>

<p>'Then? Why, men will fall on their knees before them.' As
Miss Levering made no rejoinder, 'What greater victory do women
want?' he demanded.</p>

<p>For the first time Miss Levering bent her head forward slightly
as though to see how far he was conscious of the fatuity of his
climax. But his flushed face showed a childlike good faith.</p>

<p>'Eh? Will any one tell me what they <i>want</i>?'</p>

<p>'Since you need to ask,' said the gently smiling woman in the
corner, 'perhaps there's more need to show than I'd quite realized.'</p>

<p>'I don't think you quite followed,' he began, with an air of forbearance.
'What I mean is&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Miss Levering jumped up. 'Lord Borrodaile!' He was standing
at the little iron gate waiting for his hostess, who had stopped
to speak to one of the gardeners. 'Wait a moment!' Vida called,
and went swiftly down the grass path. He had turned and was
advancing to meet her. 'No, come away,' she said under her
breath, 'come away quickly'&mdash;(safe on the other side of the gate)&mdash;'and
talk to me! Tell me about old, half-forgotten pictures or
about young rose trees.'</p>

<p>'Is something the matter?'</p>

<p>'I'm ruffled.'</p>

<p>'Who has ruffled you?' His tone was as serene as it was
sympathetic.</p>

<p>'Several people.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>'Why, I thought you were never ruffled.'</p>

<p>'I'm not, often.'</p>

<p>They turned down into a little green aisle between two dense
thickets of rhododendrons.</p>

<p>'It's lucky you are here,' she said irrelevantly.</p>

<p>He glanced at her face.</p>

<p>'It's not luck. It's foresight.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you arranged it? Well, I'm glad.'</p>

<p>'So am I,' he answered quietly. 'We get on rather well together,'
he added, after a moment.</p>

<p>She nodded half absently. 'I feel as if I'd known you for years
instead of for months,' she said.</p>

<p>'Yes, I have rather that feeling, too. Except that I'm always
a little nervous when I meet you again after an interval.'</p>

<p>'Nervous,' she frowned. 'Why nervous?'</p>

<p>'I'm always afraid you'll have some news for me.'</p>

<p>'What news?'</p>

<p>'Oh, the usual thing. That a pleasant friendship is going to be
interrupted if not broken by some one's carrying you off. It
would be a pity, you know.'</p>

<p>'Then you don't agree with Lord John.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I suppose you <i>ought</i> to marry,' he said, with smiling impatience,
'and I'm very sure you will! But I shan't like it'&mdash;he
wound up with an odd little laugh&mdash;'and neither will you.'</p>

<p>'It's an experiment I shall never try.'</p>

<p>He smiled, but as he glanced at her he grew grave. 'I've heard
more than one young woman say that, but you look as if it might
really be so.'</p>

<p>'It is so.'</p>

<p>He waited, and then, switching at the wild hyacinths with his
stick&mdash;</p>

<p>'Of course,' he said, 'I have no right to suppose you are going
to give me your reasons.'</p>

<p>'No. That's why I shall never even consider marrying&mdash;so
that I shall not have to set out my reasons.'</p>

<p>He had never seen that look in her face before. He made an
effort to put aside the trouble of it, saying almost lightly&mdash;</p>

<p>'I often wonder why people can't be happy as they are!'</p>

<p>'They think of the future, I suppose.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>'There's no such thing as the future.'</p>

<p>'You can't say there's no such thing as growth. If it's only a
garden, it's natural to like to see life unfolding&mdash;that's the future.'</p>

<p>'Yes, in spite of resolutions, you'll be trying the great experiment.'
He said it wearily.</p>

<p>'Why should you mind so?' she asked curiously; 'you are not
in love with me.'</p>

<p>'How do you know?'</p>

<p>'Because you give me such a sense of rest.'</p>

<p>'Thank you.' He caught himself up. 'Or perhaps I should
thank my grey hair.'</p>

<p>'Grey hair doesn't bring the thing I mean. I've sometimes
wished it did. But our friendship is an uncommonly peaceful
one, don't you think?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I think it is,' he said. 'All the same, you know there's
a touch of magic in it.' But, as though to condone the confession,
'You haven't told me why you were ruffled.'</p>

<p>'It's nothing. I dare say I was a little tired.'</p>

<p>They had come out into the park. 'I hurried so to catch the
train. My sister's new coachman is stupid about finding short
cuts in London, and we got blocked by a procession&mdash;a horrible
sort of demonstration, you know.'</p>

<p>'Oh, the unemployed.'</p>

<p>'Yes. And I got so tired of leaning out of the window and
shouting directions that I left the maid and the luggage to come
later. I got out of the brougham and ran through a slum, or I'd
have lost my train. I nearly lost it anyway, because I saw a queer
picture that made me stop.' She stopped again at the mere
memory of it.</p>

<p>'In a second-hand shop?'</p>

<p>He turned his pointed face to her, and the grey-green eyes wore
a gleam of interest that few things could arouse in their cool depths.</p>

<p>'No, not in a shop.' She stopped and leaned against a tree.
'In the street. It was a middle-aged workman. When I caught
sight of his back and saw his worn clothes&mdash;the coat went up in
the middle, and had that despairing sag on both sides&mdash;it crossed
my mind, here's another of those miserable, unemployed wastrels
obstructing my way! Then he looked round and I saw&mdash;solid
content in his face!' She stopped a moment.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>'So he <i>wasn't</i> one of the&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well, I wondered. I couldn't see at first what it was he had
looked round at. Then I noticed he had a rope in his hand, and
was dragging something. As the people who had been between
us hurried on I saw&mdash;I saw a child, two or three years old, in a
flapping, pink sun-bonnet. He was sitting astride a toy horse.
The horse was clumsily made, and had lost its tail. But it had
its head still, and the board it was mounted on had fat, wooden
rollers. The horse was only about that long, and so near the
ground that, for all his advantage in the matter of rollers, still the
little rider's feet touched the pavement. They even trailed and
lurched, as the horse went on, in that funny, spasmodic gait. The
child had to half walk, or, rather, make the motions&mdash;you know,
without actually bearing any of even his own weight. The slack-shouldered
man did it all. I crossed to the other side of the street,
and stood and watched them till, as I say, I nearly lost my train.
The dingy workman, smoking imperturbably, dragging the grotesque,
almost hidden, horse&mdash;the delighted child in the flapping
sun-bonnet&mdash;the crisis when they came to the crossing! The man
turned and called out something. The child declined to budge.
I wondered what would happen. So did the man. He waited a
moment, and puffed smoke and considered. The baby dug his
heels in the pavement and shouted. Then I saw the man carefully
tilt the toy horse up by the rope. I stood and watched the successful
surmounting of the obstacle, and the triumphant progress as
before&mdash;sun-bonnet flapping, smoke curling. Of course the man
was content! He had lost the battle. You saw that in his lined
face. What did it matter? <i>He held the future by a string.</i>'</p>

<p>Lord Borrodaile lifted his eyes and looked at her. Without a
word the two walked on.</p>

<p>The first to speak after the silence was the man. He pointed
out a curious effect of the light, and reminded her who had painted
it best&mdash;</p>

<p>'Corot could do these things!'&mdash;and he flung a stone in passing
at the New Impressionists.</p>

<p>At the Lodge Gate they found Lady John with Filey and Hermione.</p>

<p>'We thought if we walked this way we might meet Jean and her
bodyguard. But I mustn't go any further.' Lady John consulted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>her watch. 'The rest of you can take your time, but I have to go
and receive my other guest.'</p>

<p>Filey and Hermione were still at the gate. The girl had caught
sight of Farnborough being driven by the park road to the station.</p>

<p>'Oh, I do believe it's the new mare they're trying in the dogcart,'
said Hermione. 'Let's wait and see her go by.'</p>

<p>Borrodaile and his companion kept at Lady John's side.</p>

<p>'I'm glad,' said Vida, 'that I shall at last make acquaintance
with your Jean.'</p>

<p>'Yes; it's odd your never having met, especially as she knows
your cousins at Bishopsmead so well.'</p>

<p>'I've been so little in England&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know. A great business it is,' Lady John explained to
Lord Borrodaile, 'each time to get that crusty old Covenanter,
Jean's grandfather, to allow her to stay at Bishopsmead. So it's
the sadder for them to have her visit cut short.'</p>

<p>'Why is it cut short?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Because the hostess took to her bed yesterday with a chill, and
her temperature was a hundred and one this afternoon.'</p>

<p>'Really?' said Miss Levering. 'I hadn't heard&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'She is rather bad, I'm afraid. We are taking over another of
her guests. Of course you know him&mdash;Geoffrey Stonor.'</p>

<p>'Taking him over?' Miss Levering repeated.</p>

<p>'Yes; he was originally going to Bishopsmead this week-end,
but as he's been promising for ages to come here, it's been arranged
that we should take him off their hands. Of course we're delighted.'</p>

<p>Miss Levering walked on, between her two companions, looking
straight in front of her. As Lady John, with a glance at her
watch, quickened the pace&mdash;</p>

<p>'I'm rather unhappy at what you tell me about my cousin,' said
Vida. 'She's a delicate creature.' Then, as though acting on a
sudden impulse, Vida paused. 'You mustn't mind, Lady John,
but I shall have to go to her. Can I have a trap of some sort to
take me over?'</p>

<p>She put aside the objections with a gentle but unmistakable decision
that made Lady John say&mdash;</p>

<p>'I'm sure I've alarmed you more than there was the least need
for. But the carriage shall wait and bring you back just as soon
as you've satisfied yourself.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>'I can't tell, of course, till I've seen Mary. But may my maid
be told not to unpack&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Not unpack!'</p>

<p>'In case I have to send for my things.'</p>

<p>'My <i>dear</i>!' Lady John stopped short for very vexation.
'<i>Don't</i> desert us! I've been so congratulating myself on having
you, since I knew Geoffrey Stonor was coming.' Again she
glanced nervously at her watch. 'He is due in ten minutes!
John won't like it if I'm not there.'</p>

<p>As she was about to hurry on, the other slackened pace. She
seemed to be revolving some further plan.</p>

<p>'Why shouldn't'&mdash;she turned suddenly&mdash;'why shouldn't the
dogcart take me on after dropping Mr. Farnborough at the station?
Yes, that will be simplest. Mr. Farnborough!' she waved to him
as the cart came in sight, 'Wait! Good-bye! Forgive my rushing
off, won't you?' she called back over her shoulder, and then
with that swift, light step of hers, she covered by a short cut the
little distance that lay between her and the lodge gate.</p>

<p>'I wish I'd held my tongue,' said Lady John almost angrily as
she hastened in the opposite direction. Already some sense
seemed to reach her of the hopelessness of expecting Vida's return.</p>

<p>'I didn't <i>dream</i> she cared so much for that dull cousin of hers!'</p>

<p>'Do you think she really does?' said Borrodaile, dryly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>About Vida's little enterprise on a certain Sunday a few weeks
later was an air of elaborate mystery. Yet the expedition was no
further than to Trafalgar Square. It was there that those women,
the so-called 'Suffragettes,' in the intervals of making worse public
disturbances, were rumoured to be holding open-air meetings&mdash;a
circumstance distinctly fortunate for any one who wanted to
'see what they were like,' and who was yet unwilling to commit
herself by doing anything so eccentric as publicly to seek admission
under any roof known to show hospitality to 'such goings on.'
In those days, only a year ago, and yet already such ancient history
that the earlier pages are forgotten and scarce credible if
recalled, it took courage to walk past the knots of facetious loafers,
and the unblushing Suffragette poster, into the hall where the
meetings were held. Deliberately to sit down among odd, misguided
persons in rows, to listen to, and by so much to lend public
countenance to 'women of that sort'&mdash;the sort that not only
wanted to vote (quaint creatures!), but were not content with
merely wanting to&mdash;for the average conventional woman to venture
upon a step so compromising, to risk seeming for a moment
to take these crazy brawlers seriously, was to lay herself open to
'the comic laugh'&mdash;most dreaded of all the weapons in the social
armoury. But it was something wholly different to set out for a
Sunday Afternoon Concert, or upon some normal and recognized
philanthropic errand, and on the way find one's self arrested for a
few minutes by seeing a crowd gathered in a public square. Yet it
had not been easy to screw Mrs. Fox-Moore up to thinking even
this non-committal measure a possible one to pursue. 'What
would anybody think,' she had asked Vida, 'to see them lending
even the casual support of a presence (however ironic) to so reprehensible
a spectacle!' Had it not been for very faith in the
eccentricity of the proceeding&mdash;one wildly unlikely to be adopted,
Mrs. Fox-Moore felt, by any one else of 'their kind'&mdash;she would
never have consented to be drawn into Vida's absurd project.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course it was absolutely essential to disguise the object of
the outing from Mr. Fox-Moore. Not merely because with the
full weight of his authority he would most assuredly have forbidden
it, but because of a nervous prefiguring on his wife's part
of the particular things he would say, and the particular way he
would look in setting his extinguisher on the enterprise.</p>

<p>Vida, from the first, had never explained or excused herself to
him, so that when he asked at luncheon what she was going to do
with this fine Sunday afternoon, she had simply smiled, and said,
'Oh, I have a tryst to keep.'</p>

<p>It was her sister who added anxiously, 'Is Wood leading now
at the Queen's Hall Concerts?' And so, without actually committing
herself to a lie, gave the impression that music was to be
their quest.</p>

<p>An hour later, while the old man was nursing his gout by the
library window, he saw the ladies getting into a hansom. In spite
of the inconvenience to his afflicted member he got up and opened
the window.</p>

<p>'Don't tell me you're doing anything so rational&mdash;you two&mdash;as
going to a concert.'</p>

<p>'Why do you say that? You know I never like to take the
horses out on Sunday&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Rubbish! You think a dashing, irresponsible hansom is more
in keeping with the Factory Girls' Club or some giddy Whitechapel
frivolity!'</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox-Moore gave her sister a look of miserable apprehension;
but the younger woman laughed and waved a hand. She
knew that, even more than the hansom, their 'get up' had given
them away. It must be confessed she had felt quite as strongly
as her sister that it wouldn't do to be recognized at a Suffragette
meeting. Even as a nameless 'fine lady' standing out from a mob
of the dowdy and the dirty, to be stared at by eyes however undiscerning,
under circumstances so questionable, would be distinctly
distasteful.</p>

<p>So, reversing the order of Nature, the butterfly had retired into
a 'grubby' state. In other words, Vida had put on the plainest
of her discarded mourning-gowns. From a small Tuscan straw
travelling-toque, the new maid, greatly wondering at such instructions,
had extracted an old paste buckle and some violets, leaving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>it 'not fit to be seen.' In spite of having herself taken these precautions,
Vida had broken into uncontrollable smiles at the apparition
of Mrs. Fox-Moore, asking with pride&mdash;</p>

<p>'Will I do? I look quite like a Woman of the People, don't I?'</p>

<p>The unconscious humour of the manifestation filled Miss Levering
with an uneasy merriment every time she turned her eyes that
way.</p>

<p>Little as Mr. Fox-Moore thought of his wife's taste, either in
clothes or in amusements, he would have been more mystified than
ever he had been in his life had he seen her hansom, ten minutes
later, stop on the north side of Trafalgar Square, opposite the
National Gallery.</p>

<p>'Look out and see,' she said, retiring guiltily into the corner of
the conveyance. 'Are they there?' And it was plain that nothing
could more have relieved Mrs. Fox-Moore at that moment than
to hear 'they' were not.</p>

<p>But Vida, glancing discreetly out of the side window, had said&mdash;</p>

<p>'There? I should think they are&mdash;and a crowd round them
already. Look at their banners!' and she laughed as she leaned
out and read the legend, 'We demand VOTES FOR WOMEN'
inscribed in black letters on the white ground of two pieces of
sheeting stretched each between a pair of upright poles, standing
one on either side of the plinth of Nelson's column. In the very
middle, and similarly supported, was a banner of blood red. Upon
this one, in great white letters, appeared the legend&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
'EFFINGHAM, THE ENEMY<br />
<span class="smcap">of</span><br />
WOMEN AND THE WORKERS.'<br />
</p>

<p>As Vida read it out&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>What!</i>' ejaculated her sister. 'They haven't really got that
on a banner!' And so intrigued was she that, like some shy
creature dwelling in a shell, cautiously she protruded her head out
of the shiny, black sheath of the hansom.</p>

<p>But as she did so she met the innocent eye of a passer-by, tired
of craning his neck to look back at the meeting. With precipitation
Mrs. Fox-Moore withdrew into the innermost recesses of the
black shell.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>'Come, Janet,' said Vida, who had meanwhile jumped out and
settled the fare.</p>

<p>'Did that man know us?' asked the other, lifting up the flap
from the back window of the hansom and peering out.</p>

<p>'No, I don't think so.'</p>

<p>'He stared, Vida. He certainly stared very hard.'</p>

<p>Still she hesitated, clinging to the friendly shelter of the hansom.</p>

<p>'Oh, come on! He only stared because&mdash;&mdash; He took you for
a Suffragette!' But the indiscretion lit so angry a light in the
lady's eye, that Vida was fain to add, 'No, no, do come&mdash;and I'll
tell you what he was really looking at.'</p>

<p>'What?' said Mrs. Fox-Moore, putting out her head again.</p>

<p>'He was struck,' said Vida, biting her lip to repress smiles, 'by
the hat of the Woman of the People.'</p>

<p>But the lady was too entirely satisfied with her hat to mind Vida's
poking fun at it.</p>

<p>'"Effingham, the Enemy!"' Mrs. Fox-Moore read for herself
as they approached the flaunting red banner. 'How perfectly
outrageous!'</p>

<p>'How perfectly <i>silly</i>!' amended the other, 'when one thinks of
that kind and charming Pillar of Excellence!'</p>

<p>'I told you they were mad as well as bad.'</p>

<p>'I know; and now we're going to watch them prove it. Come on.'</p>

<p>'Why, they've stopped the fountains!' Mrs. Fox-Moore spoke
as though detecting an additional proof of turpitude. 'Those two
policemen,' she went on, in a whisper, 'why are they looking at <i>us</i>
like that?'</p>

<p>Vida glanced at the men. Their eyes were certainly fixed on
the two ladies in a curious, direct fashion, not exactly impudent,
but still in a way no policeman had ever looked at either of them
before. A coolly watchful, slightly contemptuous stare, interrupted
by one man turning to say something to the other, at which
both grinned. Vida was conscious of wishing that she had come
in her usual clothes&mdash;above all, that Janet had not raked out
that 'jumble sale' object she had perched on her head.</p>

<p>The wearer of the incriminatory hat, acting upon some quite
unanalyzed instinct to range herself unmistakably on the side of
law and order, paused as they were passing the two policemen and
addressed them with dignity.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>'Is it safe to stop and listen for a few minutes to these people?'</p>

<p>The men looked at Mrs. Fox-Moore with obvious suspicion.</p>

<p>'I cawn't say,' said the one nearest.</p>

<p>'Do you expect any trouble?' she demanded.</p>

<p>There was a silence, and then the other policeman said with a
decidedly snubby air&mdash;</p>

<p>'It ain't our business to go <i>lookin'</i> fur trouble;' and he turned
his eyes away.</p>

<p>'Of course not,' said Vida, pleasantly, coming to her sister's
rescue. 'All this lady wants to be assured of is that there are
enough of you present to make it safe&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'If ladies wants to be safe,' said number one, 'they'd better stop
in their 'omes.'</p>

<p>'That's the first rude policeman I ever&mdash;&mdash;' began Mrs. Fox-Moore,
as they went on.</p>

<p>'Well, you know he's only echoing what we all say.'</p>

<p>Vida was looking over the crowd to where on the plinth of the
historic column the little group of women and a solitary man stood
out against the background of the banners. Here they were&mdash;these
new Furies that pursued the agreeable men one sat by at
dinner&mdash;men who, it was well known, devoted their lives&mdash;when
they weren't dining&mdash;to the welfare of England. But were these
frail, rather depressed-looking women&mdash;were they indeed the
ones, outrageously daring, who broke up meetings and bashed in
policemen's helmets? Nothing very daring in their aspect to-day&mdash;a
little weary and preoccupied they looked, as they stood up
there in twos and threes, talking to one another in that exposed
position of theirs, while from time to time about their ears like
spent bullets flew the spasmodic laughter and rude comment
of the crowd&mdash;strangely unconscious, those 'blatant sensation-mongers,'
of the thousand eyes and the sea of upturned faces!</p>

<p>'Not <i>quite</i> what I expected!' said Mrs. Fox-Moore, with an
unmistakable accent of disappointment. It was plainly her meaning
that to a general reprehensibleness, dulness was now superadded.</p>

<p>'Perhaps these are not the ones,' said Vida, catching at hope.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox-Moore took heart. 'Suppose we find out,' she suggested.</p>

<p>They had penetrated the fringe of a gathering composed largely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>of weedy youths and wastrel old men. A few there were who
looked like decent artizans, but more who bore the unmistakable
aspect of the beery out-of-work. Among the strangely few women,
were two or three girls of the domestic servant or Strand Restaurant
cashier class&mdash;wearers of the cheap lace blouse and the wax bead
necklace.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox-Moore, forgetting some of her reluctance now that
she was on the spot, valiantly followed Vida as the younger woman
threaded her way among the constantly increasing crowd. Just
in front of where the two came to a final standstill was a quiet-looking
old man with a lot of unsold Sunday papers under one arm
and wearing like an apron the bill of the <i>Sunday Times</i>. Many of
the boys and young men were smoking cigarettes. Some of the
older men had pipes. Mrs. Fox-Moore commented on the inferior
taste in tobacco as shown by the lower orders. But she, too, kept
her eyes glued to the figures up there on the plinth.</p>

<p>'They've had to get men to hold up their banners for them,'
laughed Vida, as though she saw a symbolism in the fact, further
convicting these women of folly.</p>

<p>'But there's a well-dressed man&mdash;that one who isn't holding
up anything that I can see&mdash;what on earth is <i>he</i> doing there?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps he'll be upholding something later.'</p>

<p>'Going to speak, you mean?'</p>

<p>'It may be a debate. Perhaps he's going to present the other
side.'</p>

<p>'Well, if he does, I hope he'll tell them plainly what he thinks
of them.'</p>

<p>She said it quite distinctly for the benefit of the people round
her. Both ladies were still obviously self-conscious, occupied with
the need to look completely detached, to advertise: '<i>I'm</i> not one
of them! Never think it!' But it was gradually being borne in
upon them that they need take no further trouble in this connection.
Nobody in the crowd noticed any one except 'those ordinary
looking persons,' as Mrs. Fox-Moore complainingly called them,
up there on the plinth&mdash;'quite like what one sees on the tops of
omnibuses!' Certainly it was an exercise in incongruity to compare
these quiet, rather depressed looking people with the vision
conjured up by Lord John's 'raving lunatics,' 'worthy of the
straight jacket,' or Paul Filey's 'sexless monstrosities.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>'It's rather like a jest that promised very well at the beginning,
only the teller has forgotten the point. Or else,' Vida added, looking
at the face of one of the women up there&mdash;'or else the mistake
was in thinking it a jest at all!' She turned away impatiently and
devoted her attention to such scraps of comment as she could overhear
in the crowd&mdash;or such, rather, as she could understand.</p>

<p>'That one&mdash;that's just come&mdash;yes, in the blue tam-o'-shanter,
that's the one I was tellin' you about,' said a red-haired man, with
a cheerful and rubicund face.</p>

<p>'<i>Looks</i> like she'd be 'andy with her fists, don't she?' contributed
a friend alongside. The boys in front and behind laughed
appreciatively.</p>

<p>But the ruddy man said, 'Fists? No. <i>She's</i> the one wot carries
the dog-whip;' and they all craned forward with redoubled
interest. It is sad to be obliged to admit that the two ladies did
precisely the same.</p>

<p>While the boys were, in addition, cat-calling and inquiring about
the dog-whip&mdash;</p>

<p>'That must be the woman the papers have been full of,' Mrs.
Fox-Moore whispered, staring at the new-comer with horrified
eyes.</p>

<p>'Yes, no doubt.' Vida, too, scrutinized her more narrowly.</p>

<p>The wearer of the 'Tam' was certainly more robust-looking than
the others, but even she had the pallor of the worker in the town.
She carried her fine head and shoulders badly, like one who has
stooped over tasks at an age when she should have been running
about the fields. She drew her thick brows together every now
and then with an effect of determination that gave her well-chiselled
features so dark and forbidding an aspect it was a surprise
to see the grace that swept into her face when, at something
one of her comrades said, she broke into a smile. Two shabby
men on Vida's left were working themselves into a fine state of
moral indignation over the laxity of the police in allowing these
women to air their vanity in public.</p>

<p>'Comin' here with tam-o'-shanters to tell us 'ow to do our
business.'</p>

<p>'It's part o' wot I mean w'en I s'y old England's on the down
gryde.'</p>

<p>'W'ich is the one in black&mdash;this end?' his companion asked,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>indicating a refined-looking woman of forty or so. 'Is that
Miss&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Miss,' chipped in a young man of respectable appearance just
behind. '<i>Miss?</i> Why, that's the mother o' the Gracchi,' and
there was a little ripple of laughter.</p>

<p>'Hasn't she got any of her jewels along with her to-day?' said
another voice.</p>

<p>'What do they mean?' demanded Mrs. Fox-Moore.</p>

<p>Vida shook her head. She herself was looking about for some
one to ask.</p>

<p>'Isn't it queer that you and I have lived all this time in the
world and have never yet been in a mixed crowd before in all our
lives?&mdash;never <i>as a part of it</i>.'</p>

<p>'I think myself it's less strange we haven't done it before than
that we're doing it now. There's the woman selling things. Let
us ask her&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>They had noticed before a faded-looking personage who had
been going about on the fringe of the crowd with a file of propagandist
literature on her arm. Vida beckoned to her. She made
her way with some difficulty through the chaffing, jostling horde,
saying steadily and with a kind of cheerful doggedness&mdash;</p>

<p>'Leaflets! Citizenship of Women, by Lothian Scott! Labour
Record! Prison Experiences of Miss&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'How much?' asked Miss Levering.</p>

<p>'What you like,' she answered.</p>

<p>Miss Levering took her change out in information. 'Can you
tell me who the speakers are?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes.' The haggard face brightened before the task.
'That one is the famous Miss Claxton.'</p>

<p>'With her face screwed up?'</p>

<p>'That's because the sun is in her eyes.'</p>

<p>'She isn't so bad-looking,' admitted Mrs. Fox-Moore.</p>

<p>'No; but just wait till she speaks!' The faded countenance of
the woman with the heavy pile of printed propaganda on her arm
was so lit with enthusiasm, that it, too, was almost good-looking,
in the same way as the younger, more regular face up there, frowning
at the people, or the sun, or the memory of wrongs.</p>

<p>'Is Miss Claxton some relation of yours?' asked Mrs. Fox-Moore.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>'No, oh, no, I don't even know her. She hasn't been out of
prison long. The man in grey&mdash;he's Mr. Henry.'</p>

<p>'Out of prison! And Henry's the chairman, I suppose.'</p>

<p>'No; the chairman is the lady in black.' The pamphlet-seller
turned away to make change for a new customer.</p>

<p>'Do you mean the mother of the Gracchi?' said Vida, at a
venture, and saw how if she herself hadn't understood the joke
the lady with the literature did. She laughed good-humouredly.</p>

<p>'Yes; that's Mrs. Chisholm.'</p>

<p>'What!' said a decent-looking but dismal sort of shopman just
behind, 'is that the mother of those dreadful young women?'</p>

<p>Neither of the two ladies were sufficiently posted in the nefarious
goings on of the 'dreadful' progeny quite to appreciate the bystander's
surprise, but they gazed with renewed interest at the
delicate face.</p>

<p>'What can the man mean! She doesn't <i>look</i>&mdash;&mdash;' Mrs. Fox-Moore
hesitated.</p>

<p>'No,' Vida helped her out with a laughing whisper; 'I agree she
doesn't <i>look</i> big enough or bad enough or old enough or bold enough
to be the mother of young women renowned for their dreadfulness.
But as soon as she opens her mouth no doubt we'll smell the brimstone.
I wish she'd begin her raging. Why are they waiting?'</p>

<p>'It's only five minutes past,' said the lady with the literature.
'I think they're waiting for Mr. Lothian Scott. He's ill. But
he'll come!' As though the example of his fidelity to the cause
nerved her to more earnest prosecution of her own modest duty,
she called out, 'Leaflets! Citizenship of Women, by Lothian
Scott!'</p>

<p>'Wot do they give ye,' inquired a half-tipsy tramp, 'fur 'awkin'
that rot about?'</p>

<p>She turned away quite unruffled. 'Citizenship of Women, one
penny.'</p>

<p>'I hope you <i>do</i> get paid for so disagreeable a job&mdash;forgive my
saying so,' said Vida.</p>

<p>'Paid? Oh, no!' she said cheerfully. 'I'm too hard at work
all week to help much. And I can't speak, so I do this. Leaflets!
Citizenship&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Is that pinched-looking creature at the end,'&mdash;Mrs. Fox-Moore
detained the pamphlet-seller to point out a painfully thin, eager
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>little figure sitting on the ledge of the plinth and looking down with
anxious eyes at the crowd&mdash;'is that one of them?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes. I thought everybody knew <i>her</i>. That's Miss Mary
O'Brian.'</p>

<p>She spoke the name with an accent of such protecting tenderness
that Vida asked&mdash;</p>

<p>'And who is Miss Mary O'Brian?' But the pamphlet-seller
had descried a possible customer, and was gone.</p>

<p>'Mary O'Brian,' said a blear-eyed old man, 'is the one that's just
come out o' quod.'</p>

<p>'Oh, thank you.' Then to her sister Vida whispered, 'What is
quod?'</p>

<p>But Mrs. Fox-Moore could only shake her head. Even when
they heard the words these strange fellow-citizens used, meaning
often failed to accompany sound.</p>

<p>'Oh, is <i>that</i> Mary?' A rollicking young rough, with his hat
on the extreme back of his head, began to sing, 'Molly Darling.'</p>

<p>'&rsquo;Ow'd yer like the skilly?' another shouted up at the girl.</p>

<p>'Skilly?' whispered Mrs. Fox-Moore.</p>

<p>Vida in turn shook her head. It wasn't in the dictionary of any
language she knew. But it seemed in some way to involve dishonour,
for the chairman, who had been consulting with the man
in grey, turned suddenly and faced the crowd. Her eyes were
shining with the light of battle, but what she said in a peculiarly
pleasant voice was&mdash;</p>

<p>'Miss O'Brian has come here for the express purpose of telling
you how she liked it.'</p>

<p>'Oh, she's going to tell us all about it. 'Ow <i>nice</i>!' But they
let the thin little slip of a girl alone after that.</p>

<p>It was a new-comer, a few moments later who called out from
the fringe of the crowd&mdash;</p>

<p>'I say, Mary, w'en yer get yer rights will y' be a perliceman?'
Even the tall, grave guardians of the peace ranged about the
monument, even they smiled at the suggested image.</p>

<p>After all, it might not be so uninteresting to listen to these people
for a few minutes. It wasn't often that life presented such an opportunity.
It probably would never occur again. These women on
the plinth must be not alone of a different world, but of a different
clay, since they not only did not shrink from disgracing themselves&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>women
had been capable of that before&mdash;but these didn't
even mind ridicule. Which was new.</p>

<p>Just then the mother of the Gracchi came to the edge of the
plinth to open the meeting.</p>

<p>'Friends!' she began. The crowd hooted that proposition to
start with. But the pale woman with the candid eyes went on as
calmly as though she had been received with polite applause, telling
the jeering crowd several things they certainly had not known
before, that, among other matters, they were met there to pass a
censure on the Government&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Haw! haw!'</p>

<p>'&rsquo;Ear, 'ear!' said the deaf old newsvendor, with his free hand
up to his ear.</p>

<p>'And to express our sympathy with the brave women&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The staccato cries throughout the audience dissolved into one
general hoot; but above it sounded the old newsvendor's '&rsquo;Ear,
'ear!'</p>

<p>'&rsquo;E can't 'ear without 'e shouts about it.'</p>

<p>'Try and keep <i>yerself</i> quiet,' said he, with dignity. 'We ain't
'ere to 'ear <i>you</i>.'</p>

<p>'&mdash;&mdash;sympathy with the brave women,' the steady voice went
on, 'who are still in prison.'</p>

<p>'Serve 'em jolly well right!'</p>

<p>'Give the speaker a chaunce, caun't ye?' said the newsvendor,
with a withering look.</p>

<p>It was plain this old gentleman was an unblushing adherent to
the cause (undismayed by being apparently the only one in that
vicinity), ready to cheer the chairman at every juncture, and equally
ready to administer caustic reproof to her opponents.</p>

<p>'Our friends who are in prison, are there simply for trying to
bring before a member of the Government&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Good old Effingham. Three cheers for Effingham!'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' said the newsvendor, 'go on! 'E needs a little
cheerin', awfter the mess 'e's made o' things!'</p>

<p>'For trying to put before a member of the Government a statement
of the injustice&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'<i>That</i> ain't why they're in gaol. It's fur ringin' wot's-'is-name's
door-bell.'</p>

<p>'Kickin' up rows in the street&mdash;&mdash;'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh, you shut up,' says the old champion, out of patience.
'You've 'ad 'arf a pint too much.'</p>

<p>Everybody in the vicinity was obliged to turn and look at the
youth to see what proportion of the charge was humour and how
much was fact. The youth resented so deeply the turn the conversation
had taken that he fell back for a moment on bitter
silence.</p>

<p>'When you go to call on some one,' the chairman was continuing,
with the patient air of one instructing a class in a kindergarten,
'it is the custom to ring the bell. What do you suppose a door-bell
is for? Do you think our deputation should have tried to get in
without ringing at the door?'</p>

<p>'They 'adn't no business goin' to 'is private 'ouse.'</p>

<p>'Oh, look 'ere, just take that extry 'arf pint outside the meetin'
and cool off, will yer?'</p>

<p>It was the last time that particular opponent aired his views.
The old man's judicious harping on the '&rsquo;arf pint' induced the
ardent youth to moderate his political transports. They were not
rightly valued, it appeared. After a few more mutterings he took
his 'extry 'alf pint' into some more congenial society. But there
were several others in the crowd who had come similarly fortified,
and they were everywhere the most audible opponents. But
above argument, denial, abuse, steadily in that upper air the clear
voice kept on&mdash;</p>

<p>'Do you think they <i>wanted</i> to go to his house? Haven't you
heard that they didn't do that until they had exhausted every other
means to get a hearing?'</p>

<p>To the shower of denial and objurgation that greeted this, she
said with uplifted hand&mdash;</p>

<p>'Stop! Let me tell you about it.'</p>

<p>The action had in it so much of authority that (as it seemed,
to their own surprise) the interrupters, with mouths still open,
suspended operations for a moment.</p>

<p>'Why, this is a woman of education! What on earth is a
person like that doing in this <i>gal&egrave;re</i>?' Vida asked, as if Mrs. Fox-Moore
might be able to enlighten her. 'Can't she see&mdash;even if
there were anything in the "Cause," as she calls it&mdash;what an
imbecile waste of time it is talking to these louts?'</p>

<p>'There's a good many voters here,' said a tall, gloomy-looking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>individual, wearing a muffler in lieu of a collar. 'She's politician
enough to know that.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox-Moore looked through the man. 'The only reassuring
thing I see in the situation,' she said to her sister, 'is that they
don't find many women to come and listen to their nonsense.'</p>

<p>'Well, they've got you and me! Awful thought! Suppose they
converted us!'</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox-Moore didn't even trouble to reply to such levity.
What was interesting was the discovery that this 'chairman,'
before an audience so unpromising, not only held her own when
she was interrupted and harassed by the crowd&mdash;even more
surprising she bore with the most recalcitrant members of it&mdash;tried
to win them over, and yet when they were rude, did not withhold
reproof, and at times looked down upon them with so fine
a scorn that it seemed as if even those ruffianly young men felt
the edge of it. Certainly a curious sight&mdash;this well-bred woman
standing there in front of the soaring column, talking with grave
passion to those loafers about the 'Great Woman Question,' and
they treating it as a Sunday afternoon street entertainment.</p>

<p>The next speaker was a working woman, the significance of
whose appearance in that place and in that company was so little
apprehended by the two ladies in the crowd that they agreed in
laughingly commiserating the chairman for not having more of
her own kind to back her up in her absurd contention. Though
the second speaker merely bored the two who, having no key either
to her pathos or her power, saw nothing but 'low cockney effrontery'
in her effort, she nevertheless had a distinct success with the
crowd. Here was somebody speaking their own language&mdash;they
paid her the tribute of their loudest hoots mixed with applause.
She never lost her hold on them until the appearance on the plinth
of a grave, rugged, middle-aged man in a soft hat.</p>

<p>'That's 'im!'</p>

<p>'Yes. Lothian Scott!'</p>

<p>Small need for the chairwoman to introduce the grey man with
the northern burr in his speech, and the northern turn for the uncompromising
in opinion. Every soul there save the two 'educated'
ladies knew this was the man who had done more to make
the Labour Party a political force to be reckoned with than any
other creature in the three kingdoms. Whether he was conscious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>of having friends in a gathering largely Tory (as lower-class crowds
still are), certainly he did not spare his enemies.</p>

<p>During the first few minutes of a speech full of Socialism, Mrs.
Fox-Moore (stirred to unheard-of expressiveness) kept up a low,
running comment&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, of <i>course</i>! He says that to curry favour with the mob&mdash;a
rank demagogue, this man! Such pandering to the populace!'
Then, turning sharply to her companion, '<i>He wants votes!</i>' she
said, as though detecting in him a taste unknown among the men
in her purer circle. 'Oh, no doubt he makes a very good thing
out of it! Going about filling the people's heads with revolutionary
ideas! Monstrous wickedness, <i>I</i> call it, stirring up class
against class! I begin to wonder what the police are thinking
about.' She looked round uneasily.</p>

<p>The excitement had certainly increased as the little grey politician
denounced the witlessness of the working-class, and when
they howled at him, went on to expound a trenchant doctrine of
universal Responsibility, which preceded the universal Suffrage
that was to come. Much of what he said was drowned in uproar.
It had become clear that his opinions revolted the majority of his
hearers even more than they did the two ladies. So outraged were
the sensibilities of the hooligan and the half-drunk that they
drowned as much of the speech as they were able in cat-calls and
jeers. But enough still penetrated to ears polite not only to horrify,
but to astonish them&mdash;such force has the spoken word above
even its exaggeration in cold print.</p>

<p>The ladies had read&mdash;sparingly, it is true&mdash;that these things
were said, but to <i>hear</i> them!</p>

<p>'He doesn't, after all, seem to be saying what the mob wants to
hear,' said the younger woman.</p>

<p>'No; mercifully the heart of the country is still sound!'</p>

<p>But for one of these two out of the orderlier world, the opposition
that the 'rank demagogue' roused in the mob was to light a lamp
whereby she read wondering the signs of an unsuspected bond
between Janet Fox-Moore and the reeking throng.</p>

<p>When, contrary to the old-established custom of the demagogue,
the little politician in homespun had confided to the men in front
of him what he thought of them, he told them that the Woman's
Movement which they held themselves so clever for ridiculing, was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>in much the same position to-day as the Extension of Suffrage for
men was in '67. Had it not been for demonstrations (beside which
the action that had lodged the women in gaol was innocent child's
play), neither he, the speaker, nor any of the men in front of him
would have the right to vote to-day.</p>

<p>'You ridicule and denounce these women for trying peacefully&mdash;yes,
I say <i>peacefully</i>&mdash;to get their rights as citizens. Do you
know what our fathers did to get ours? They broke down Hyde
Park railings, they burnt the Bristol Municipal Buildings, they
led riots, and they shed blood. These women have hurt nobody.'</p>

<p>'What about the policeman?'</p>

<p>He went on steadily, comparing the moderation of the women
with the red-hot violence of their Chartist forbears&mdash;till one half-drunken
listener, having lost the thread, hiccuped out&mdash;</p>

<p>'Can't do nothin'&mdash;them women. Even after we've showed
'em <i>'ow</i>!'</p>

<p>'Has he got his history right?' Vida asked through her smiling
at the last sally. 'Not that it applies, of course,' she was in haste
to add.</p>

<p>'Oh, what does it matter?' Her sister waved it aside. 'An
unscrupulous politician hasn't come here to bother about little
things like facts.'</p>

<p>'I don't think I altogether agree with you <i>there</i>. That man may
be a fanatic, but he's honest, I should say. Those Scotch peasants,
you know&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, because he's rude, and talks with a burr, you think he's a
sort of political Thomas Carlyle?'</p>

<p>Though Vida smiled at the charge, something in her alert air
as she followed the brief recapitulation of the Chartist story showed
how an appeal to justice, or even to pity, may fail, where the rousing
of some dim sense of historical significance (which is more than
two-thirds fear), may arrest and even stir to unsuspected deeps.
The grave Scotsman's striking that chord even in a mind as innocent
as Vida's, of accurate or ordered knowledge of the past, even
here the chord could vibrate to a strange new sense of possible
significance in this scene '&mdash;&mdash;after all.' It would be queer, it
would be horrible, it was fortunately incredible, but what if, 'after
all,' she were ignorantly assisting at a scene that was to play its
part in the greatest revolution the world had seen? Some such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>mental playing with possibilities seemed to lurk behind the intent
reflective face.</p>

<p>'There are far too many voters already,' her sister had flung out.</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;yes, a much uglier world they want to make!'</p>

<p>But in the power to make history&mdash;if these people indeed had
that, then indeed might they be worth watching&mdash;even if it were
only after one good look to hide the eyes in dismay. That possibility
of historic significance had suddenly lifted the sordid exhibition
to a different plane.</p>

<p>As the man, amid howls, ended his almost indistinguishable
peroration, the unmoved chairman stepped forward again to try
to win back for the next speaker that modicum of quiet attention
which he, at all events, had the art of gaining and of keeping. As
she came forward this time one of her auditors looked at the
Woman Leader in the Crusade with new eyes&mdash;not with sympathy,
rather with a vague alarm. Vida Levering's air of almost
strained attention was an unconscious public confession: 'I
haven't understood these strange women; I haven't understood
the spirit of the mob that hoots the man we know vaguely for their
champion; I haven't understood the allusions nor the argot that
they talk; I can't check the history that peasant has appealed to.
In the midst of so much that is obscure, it is meet to reserve judgment.'
Something of that might have been read in the look lifted
once or twice as though in wonderment, above the haggard group
up there between the guardian lions, beyond even the last reach
of the tall monument, to the cloudless sky of June. Was the great
shaft itself playing a part in the impression? Was it there not at
all for memory of some battle long ago, but just to mark on the
fair bright page of afternoon a huge surprise? What lesser accent
than just this Titanic exclamation point could fitly punctuate the
record of so strange a portent!&mdash;women confronting the populace
of the mightiest city in the world&mdash;pleading in her most
public place their right to a voice in her affairs.</p>

<p>In the face of this unexpected mood of receptivity, however unwilling,
came a sharp corrective in the person of the next speaker.</p>

<p>'Oh, it's not going to be one that's been to prison!'</p>

<p>'Oh, dear! It's the one with the wild black hair and the awful
"picture hat"!' But they stared for a few moments as if, in despite
of themselves, fascinated by this lady be-feathered, be-crimped, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>be-ringed, wearing her huge hat cocked over one ear with a defiant
coquetry above a would-be conquering smile. The unerring wits
in the crowd had already picked her out for special attention, but
her active 'public form' was even more torturing to the fastidious
feminine sense than her 'stylish' appearance. For her language,
flowery and grandiloquent, was excruciatingly genteel, one moment
conveyed by minced words through a pursed mouth, and the next
carried away on a turgid tide of rhetoric&mdash;the swimmer in this
sea of sentiment flinging out braceleted arms, and bawling appeals
to the '<i>Wim&mdash;men&mdash;nof&mdash;Vinglund!</i>' The crowd howled with
derisive joy.</p>

<p>All the same, when they saw she had staying power, and a kind
of Transpontine sense of drama in her, the populace mocked less
and applauded more. Why not? She was very much like an
overblown Adelphi heroine, and they could see her act for nothing.
But every time she apostrophized the '<i>Wim&mdash;men&mdash;nof&mdash;Vinglund!</i>'
two of those same gave way to overcharged feelings.</p>

<p>'Oh, my dear, I can't stand this! I'm going home!'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes. Let's get away from this terrible female. I suppose
they keep back the best speakers for the last.'</p>

<p>The two ladies turned, and began to edge their way out of the
tightly packed mass of humanity.</p>

<p>'It's rather a pity, too,' said Mrs. Fox-Moore, looking back,
'for this is the only chance we'll ever have. I did want to hear
what the skilly was.'</p>

<p>'Yes, and about the dog-whip.'</p>

<p>'Skilly! Sounds as if it might be what she hit the policeman
with.' Mrs. Fox-Moore was again pausing to look back. 'That
gyrating female is more what I expected them <i>all</i> to be.'</p>

<p>'Yes; but just listen to that.'</p>

<p>'To what?'</p>

<p>'Why, the way they're applauding her.'</p>

<p>'Yes, they positively revel in the creature!'</p>

<p>It was a long, tiresome business this worming their way out.
They paused again and again two or three times, looking back at
the scene with a recurrent curiosity, and each time repelled by the
platform graces of the lady who was so obviously enjoying herself
to the top of her bent. Yet even after the fleeing twain arrived
on the fringe of the greatly augmented crowd, something even then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>prevented their instantly making the most of their escape. They
stood criticizing and denouncing.</p>

<p>Again Mrs. Fox-Moore said it was a pity, since they were there,
that they should have to go without hearing one of those who had
been in prison, 'For we'll never have another chance.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps,' said her sister, looking back at the gesticulating
figure&mdash;'perhaps we're being a little unreasonable. We were
annoyed at first because they weren't what we expected, and when
we get what we came to see, we run away.'</p>

<p>While still they lingered, with a final fling of arms and toss of
plumes, the champion of the women of England sat down in the
midst of applause.</p>

<p>'You hear? It's all very well. Most of them simply loved it.'</p>

<p>And now the chairman, in a strikingly different style, was preparing
the way for the next speaker, at mention of whom the crowd
seemed to feel they'd been neglecting their prerogative of hissing.</p>

<p>'What name did she say? Why do they make that noise?'</p>

<p>The two ladies began to worm their way back; but this was a
different matter from coming out.</p>

<p>'Wot yer doin'?' some one inquired sternly of Mrs. Fox-Moore.</p>

<p>Another turned sharply, 'Look out! Oo yer pushin', old girl?'</p>

<p>The horrid low creatures seemed to have no sense of deference.
And the stuff they smoked!</p>

<p>'Pah!' observed Mrs. Fox-Moore, getting the full benefit of a
noxious puff. '<i>Pah!</i>'</p>

<p>'<i>Wot!</i>' said the smoker, turning angrily. 'Pah to you, miss!'
He eyed Mrs. Fox-Moore from head to foot with a withering scorn.
'Comin' 'ere awskin' us fur votes' (Vida nearly fainted), 'and ain't
able to stand a little tobacco.'</p>

<p>'Stand in front, Janet,' said Miss Levering, hastily recovering
herself. '<i>I</i> don't mind smoke,' she said mendaciously, trying to
appease the defiler of the air with a little smile. Indeed, the idea
of Mrs. Fox-Moore having come to 'awsk' this person for a vote
was sufficiently quaint.</p>

<p>'This is the sort of thing they mean, I suppose,' said that lady,
'when they talk about cockney humour. It doesn't appeal to me.'</p>

<p>Vida bit her lip. Her own taste was less pure. 'We needn't
try to get any nearer,' she said hastily. 'This chairman-person
can make herself heard without screeching.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>But having lost the key during the passage over the pipe, they
could only make out that she was justifying some one to the mob,
some one who apparently was coming in for too much sharp
criticism for the chairman to fling her to the wolves without first
diverting them a little. The battle of words that ensued was
almost entirely unintelligible to the two ladies, but they gathered,
through means more expressive than speech, that the chairman
was dealing with some sort of crisis in the temper of the meeting,
brought about by the mention of a name.</p>

<p>The only thing clear was that she was neither going to give in,
nor going to turn over the meeting in a state of ferment to some less
practised hand.</p>

<p>'Yes, she did! She had a perfect right,' the chairman maintained
against a storm of noes&mdash;'more than a right, <i>a duty</i>, to
perform in going with that deputation on public business to the
house of a public servant, since, unlike the late Prime Minister,
he had refused to women all opportunity to treat with him through
the usual channels always open to citizens having a political
grievance.'</p>

<p>'Citizens? Suffragettes!'</p>

<p>'Very well.' She set her mouth. 'Suffragettes if you like.
To get an abuse listened to is the first thing; to get it understood
is the next. Rather than not have our cause stand out clear and
unmistakable before a preoccupied, careless world, we accept the
clumsy label; we wear it proudly. And it won't be the first time
in history that a name given in derision has become a badge of
honour!'</p>

<p>Why, the woman's eyes were suffused!&mdash;a flush had mounted
up to her hair!</p>

<p>How she cared!</p>

<p>'Yer ain't told us the reason ye <i>want</i> the vote.'</p>

<p>'Reason? Why, she's a woman!'</p>

<p>'Haw! haw!'</p>

<p>The speaker had never paused an instant, but&mdash;it began to be
clear that she heard any interruption it suited her to hear.</p>

<p>'Some one asking, at this time of day, why women want the
vote? Why, for exactly the same reason that you men do. Because,
not having any voice in public affairs, our interests are
neglected; and since woman's interests are man's, all humanity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>suffers. We want the vote, because taxation without representation
is tyranny; because the laws as they stand bear hardly on
women; and because those unfair, man-made laws will never be
altered till women have a share in electing the men who control
legislation.'</p>

<p>'Yer ought ter leave politics to us&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We can't leave politics to the men, because politics have come
into the home, and if the higher interests of the home are to be
served, women must come into politics.'</p>

<p>'That's a bad argument!'</p>

<p>'Wot I always say is&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Can't change nature. Nature says&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Let 'er st'y at 'ome and mind 'er business!'</p>

<p>The interjections seemed to come all at once. The woman
bent over the crowd. Nothing misty in her eyes now&mdash;rather a
keener light than before.</p>

<p>'Don't you see,' she appealed to them as equals&mdash;'don't you
see that in your improvement of the world you men have taken
women's business out of her home? In the old days there was
work and responsibility enough for woman without going outside
her own gate. The women were the bakers and brewers, the soap
and candle-makers, the loom-workers of the world. You men,'
she said, delicately flattering them, '<i>you</i> have changed all that.
You have built great factories and warehouses and mills. But
how do you keep them going? By calling women to come in their
thousands and help you. But women love their homes. You
couldn't have got these women out of their homes without the goad
of poverty. You men can't always earn enough to keep the poor
little home going, so the women work in the shops, they swarm
at the mill gates, and the factories are full.'</p>

<p>'True! True, every blessed word!' said the old newsvendor.</p>

<p>'Hush!' she said. 'Don't interrupt. In taking women's business
out of the home you haven't freed her from the need to see
after the business. The need is greater than ever it was. Why,
eighty-two per cent of the women of this country are wage-earning
women! Yet, you go on foolishly echoing: Woman's place is at
home.'</p>

<p>'True! True!' said the aged champion, unabashed.</p>

<p>'Then there are those men, philanthropists, statesmen, who be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>lieve
they are safeguarding the interests of women by making laws
restricting their work, and so restricting their resources without
ever consulting these women. If they consulted these women, they
would hear truths that would open their blind eyes. But no, the
woman isn't worthy of being consulted. She is worthy to do the
highest work given to humanity, to bear and to bring up children;
she is worthy to teach and to train them; she is worthy to pay the
taxes that she has no voice in levying. If she breaks the law that
she has no share in making, she is worth hanging, but she is not
worth consulting about her own affairs&mdash;affairs of supremest
importance to her very existence&mdash;affairs that no man, however
great and good, can understand so well as she. She will never
get justice until she gets the vote. Even the well-to-do middle-class
woman&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Wot are <i>you</i>?'</p>

<p>'And even the woman of what are called the upper classes&mdash;even
she must wince at the times when men throw off the mask
and let her see how in their hearts they despise her. A few weeks
ago Mr. Lothian Scott&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Boo! Boo!'</p>

<p>'Hooray!'</p>

<p>'&rsquo;ray for Lothian Scott!'</p>

<p>In the midst of isolated cheers and a volume of booing, she
went on&mdash;</p>

<p>'When he brought a resolution before the House of Commons
to remove the sex disqualification, what happened?'</p>

<p>'Y' kicked up a row!'</p>

<p>'Lot o' yer got jugged!'</p>

<p>'The same thing happened that has been happening for half a
century every time the question comes up in that English Parliament
that Englishmen are supposed to think of with such respect
as a place of dignity. What <i>happened</i>?' She leaned forward
and her eyes shone. 'What happened in that sacred place, that
Ark where they safeguard the honour of England? What happened
to <i>our</i> honour, that these men dare tell us is so safe in their
hands? Our cause was dragged through filth. The very name
"woman" was used as a signal for jests and ribald laughter, and
for such an exhibition of sex rancour and mistrust that it passed
imagination to think what the mothers and wives of the members
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>must think of the public confession of the deep disrespect their
menfolk feel for them. Some one here spoke of "a row."' She
threw back her head, and faced the issue as though she knew that
by bringing it forward herself, she could turn the taunt against
the next speaker into a title of respect. 'You blame us for making
a scene in that holy place! You would have us imitate those other
women&mdash;the well-behaved&mdash;the women who think more of manners
than of morals. There they were&mdash;for an example to us&mdash;that
night of the debate, that night of the "row"&mdash;there they sat
as they have always done, like meek mute slaves up there in their
little gilded pen, ready to listen to any insult, ready to smile on the
men afterward. In only one way, but it was an important exception,
in just one way that debate on Woman Suffrage differed
from any other that had ever taken place in the House of Commons.'</p>

<p>A voice in the crowd was raised, but before the jeer was out
Mrs. Chisholm had flung down her last ringing sentences.</p>

<p>'There were <i>others</i> up there in the little pen that night!&mdash;women,
too&mdash;but women with enough decency to be revolted,
and with enough character to resent such treatment as the members
down there on the floor of the House were giving to our
measure. Though the women who ought to have felt it most sat
there cowed and silent, I am proud to think there were other
women who cried out, "<i>Shame!</i>" Yes, yes,' she interrupted the
interrupters, 'those women were dragged away to prison, and all
the world was aghast. But I tell you that cry was the beginning
of a new chapter in human history. It began with "Shame!"
but it will end with "Honour."'</p>

<p>The old newsvendor led the applause.</p>

<p>'Janet! That woman never spat in a policeman's face.'</p>

<p>'Pull down your veil,' was the lady's sharp response.
'Quick&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'My&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, pull it down, and don't turn round.'</p>

<p>A little dazed by the red-hot torrent the woman on the plinth
was still pouring down on the people, Vida's mind at the word
'veil,' so peremptorily uttered, reverted by some trick of association
to the Oriental significance of that mark in dress distinctively
the woman's.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>'Why should I pull down my veil?' she answered abstractedly.</p>

<p>'They're looking this way. Don't turn round. Come, come.'</p>

<p>With a surprising alacrity and skill Mrs. Fox-Moore made her
way out of the throng. Vida, following, yet looking back, heard&mdash;</p>

<p>'Now, I want you men to give a fair hearing to a woman
who&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Vida, <i>don't</i> look! Mercifully, they're too much amused to
notice us.'</p>

<p>Disobeying the mandate, the younger woman's eyes fell at last
upon the figures of two young men hovering on the outer circle.
The sun caught their tall, glossy hats, played upon the single
flower in the frock coat, struck on the eyeglass, and gleamed
mockingly on the white teeth of the one who smiled the broadest
as they both stood, craning their necks, whispering and laughing,
on the fringe of the crowd.</p>

<p>'Why, it's Dick Farnborough&mdash;and that friend of his from the
Austrian Embassy.'</p>

<p>Vida pulled down her veil.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>Devoutly thankful at having escaped from her compromising
position unrecognized, Mrs. Fox-Moore firmly declined to go
'awskin' fur the vote' again! When Vida gave up her laughing
remonstrance, Mrs. Fox-Moore thought her sister had also given
up the idea. But as Vida afterwards confessed, she told herself
that she would go 'just once more.' It could not be but what she
was under some illusion about that queer spectacle. From one
impression each admitted it was difficult to shake herself free.
Whatever those women were or were not, they weren't fools.
What did the leaders (in prison and out), what did they think they
were accomplishing, besides making themselves hideously uncomfortable?
The English Parliament, having flung them out, had
gone on with its routine, precisely as though nothing had happened.
<i>Had</i> anything happened? That was the question. The
papers couldn't answer. They were given over to lies. The
bare idea of women pretending to concern themselves with public
affairs&mdash;from the point of view of the Press, it was enough to
make the soberest sides shake with Homeric laughter.</p>

<p>So, then, one last time to see for one's self. And on this occasion
no pettiness of disguise, Miss Levering's aspect seemed to
say&mdash;no recurrence of any undignified flight. She had been
frightened away from her first meeting, but she would not be
frightened from the second, which was also to be the last.</p>

<p>An instinct unanalyzed, but significant of what was to follow,
kept her from seeking companionship outside. Had Wark not
gone over to the market-gardener, her former mistress would have
had no misgiving about taking the woman into her confidence.
But Wark, with lightning rapidity, had become Mrs. Anderson
Slynes, and was beyond recall. So the new maid was told the
following Sunday, that she might walk with her mistress across
Hyde Park (where the papers said the meetings in future were to
be), carrying some music which had to be returned to the Tunbridges.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Pursuing this programme, what more natural than that those
two chance pedestrians should be arrested by an apparition on their
way, of a flaming banner bearing, along with a demand for the
vote, an outrageous charge against a distinguished public servant&mdash;'a
pity the misguided creatures didn't know him, just a little!'</p>

<p>Yes. There it was! a rectangle of red screaming across the
vivid green of the park not a hundred yards from the Marble
Arch, the denunciatory banner stretched above the side of an uncovered
van. A little crowd of perhaps a hundred collected on
one side of the cart&mdash;the loafers on the outermost fringe, lying
on the grass. Never a sign of a Suffragette, and nearly three
o'clock! Impossible for any passer-by to carry out the programme
of pausing to ask idly, 'What are those women screeching about?'</p>

<p>Seeming to search in vain for some excuse to linger, Miss Levering's
wandering eye fell upon a young mother wheeling a perambulator.
She had glanced with mild curiosity at the flaunting
ensign, and then turned from it to lean forward and straighten
her baby's cap.</p>

<p>'I wonder what <i>she</i> thinks of the Woman Question,' Miss Levering
observed, in a careless aside to her maid.</p>

<p>Before Gorringe could reply: 'Doddy's a bootiful angel, isn't
Doddy?' said the young mother, with subdued rapture.</p>

<p>'Ah, she's found the solution,' said the lady, looking back.</p>

<p>Other pedestrians glanced at the little crowd about the cart,
read demand and denunciation on the banner, laughed, and they,
too, for the most part, went on.</p>

<p>An Eton boy, who looked as if he might be her grandson, came
by with a white-haired lady of distinguished aspect, who held up
her voluminous silken skirts and stared silently at the legend.</p>

<p>'Do you see what it says?' the Eton boy laughed as he looked
back. '"<i>We demand the vote.</i>" Fancy! They "demand" it.
What awful cheek!' and he laughed again at the fatuity of the
female creature.</p>

<p>Vida glanced at the dignified old dame as though with an uneasy
new sense of the incongruity in the attitude of those two quite
commonplace, everyday members of a world that was her world,
and that yet could for a moment look quite strange.</p>

<p>She turned and glanced back at the ridiculous cart as if summoning
the invisible presence of Mrs. Chisholm to moderate the inso<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>lence
of the budding male. Still there was no sign either of Mrs.
Chisholm or any of her fellow-conspirators against the old order
of the world. Miss Levering stood a moment hesitating.</p>

<p>'I believe I'm a little tired,' she said to the discreet maid. 'We'll
rest here a moment,' and she sat down with her back to the crowd.</p>

<p>A woman, apparently of the small shopkeeping class, was already
established at one end of the only bench anywhere near the cart.
Her child who was playing about, was neatly dressed, and to Vida's
surprise wore sandals on her stockingless feet. This fashion for
children, which had been growing for years among the upper
classes, had found little imitation among tradesmen or working
people. They presumably were still too near the difficulty of
keeping their children in shoes and stockings, to be able to see
anything but a confession of failure in going without. In the
same way, the 'Simple Life,' when led by the rich, wears to the
poverty-struck an aspect of masked meanness&mdash;a matter far less
tolerable in the eyes of the pauper than the traditional splendour
of extravagance in the upper class, an extravagance that feeds
more than the famished stomach with the crumbs that it lets fall.</p>

<p>As Miss Levering sat watching the child, and wondering a little
at the sandals, the woman caught her eye.</p>

<p>'Could you please tell me the time?' she asked.</p>

<p>Miss Levering took out her watch, and then spoke of the wisdom
of that plan of sandals.</p>

<p>The woman answered with such self-possession and good sense,
that the lady sent a half-amused glance over her shoulder as if
relishing in advance the sturdy disapproval of this highly respectable
young mother when she should come to realize how near she
and the precious daughter were to the rostrum of the Shrieking
Sisterhood. It might be worth prolonging the discussion upon
health and education for the amusement there would be in seeing
what form condemnation of the Suffragettes took among people
of this kind. By turning her head to one side, out of the tail of
her eye the lady could see that an excitement of some sort was
agitating the crowd. The voices rose more shrill. People craned
and pushed. A derisive cheer went up as a woman appeared on
the cart. The wearer of the tam-o'-shanter! Three others followed&mdash;all
women. Miss Levering saw without seeming to look,
still listening while the practical-minded mother talked on about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>her child, and what 'was good for it.' All life had resolved itself
into pursuit of that.</p>

<p>An air of semi-abstraction came over the lady. It was as if in
the presence of this excellent bourgeoise she felt an absurd constraint
in showing an interest in the proceedings of these unsexed
creatures behind them.</p>

<p>To her obvious astonishment the mother of the child was the
first to jump up.</p>

<p>'Now they're going to begin!' she said briskly.</p>

<p>'Who?' asked Miss Levering.</p>

<p>'Why, the Suffrage people.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Are <i>you</i> going to listen to them?'</p>

<p>'Yes; that's what I've come all this way for.' And she and her
bare-legged offspring melted into the growing crowd.</p>

<p>Vida turned to the maid and met her superior smile. 'That
woman says she has come a long way to hear these people advocating
Woman's Suffrage,' and slowly with an air of complete detachment
she approached the edge of the crowd, followed by the supercilious
maid. They were quickly hemmed in by people who seemed
to spring up out of the ground. It was curious to look back over
the vivid green expanse and see the dotted humanity running like
ants from all directions to listen to this handful of dowdy women
in a cart!</p>

<p>In finding her way through the crowd it would appear that the
lady was not much sustained by the presence of a servant, however
well-meaning. Much out of place in such a gathering as Mrs.
Fox-Moore or any ultra-oldfashioned woman was, still more
incongruous showed there the relation of mistress and maid.
The punctilious Gorringe was plainly horrified at the proximity
to her mistress of these canaille, and the mistress was not so
absorbed it would seem but what she felt the affront to seemliness
in a servant's seeing her pushed and shoved aside&mdash;treated with
slight regard or none. Necessary either to leave the scene with
lofty disapproval, or else make light of the discomfort.</p>

<p>'It doesn't matter!' she assured the girl, who was trying to
protect her mistress's dainty wrap from contact with a grimy
tramp. And, again, when half a dozen boys forced their way
past, 'It's all right!' she nodded to the maid, 'it's no worse than
the crowd at Charing Cross coming over from Paris.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was much worse, and Gorringe knew it. 'The old man
is standing on your gown, miss.'</p>

<p>'Oh, would you mind&mdash;&mdash;' Miss Levering politely suggested
another place for his feet.</p>

<p>But the old man had no mind left for a mere bystander&mdash;it was
all absorbed in Suffragettes.</p>

<p>'&rsquo;is feet are filthy muddy, 'm,' whispered Gorringe.</p>

<p>It may have been in part the maid's genteel horror of such
proximities that steeled Miss Levering to endure them. Under
circumstances like these the observant are reminded that no
section of the modern community is so scornfully aristocratic
as our servants. Their horror of the meanly-apparelled and the
humble is beyond the scorn of kings. The fine lady shares her
shrinking with those inveterate enemies of democracy, the lackey
who shuts the door in the shabby stranger's face, and the dog
who barks a beggar from the gate.</p>

<p>And so while the maid drew her own skirts aside and held her
nose high in the air, the gentlewoman stood faintly smiling at the
queer scene.</p>

<p>Alas! no Mrs. Chisholm. It looked as if they must have been
hard up for speakers to-day, for two of them were younger even
than Miss Claxton of the tam-o'-shanter. One of them couldn't
be more than nineteen.</p>

<p>'How dreadful to put such very young girls up there to be stared
at by all these louts!'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, 'm, quite 'orrid,' agreed the maid, but with the air of
'What can you expect of persons so low?'</p>

<p>'However, the young girls seem to have as much self-possession
as the older ones!' pursued Miss Levering, as she looked in vain
for any sign of flinching from the sallies of cockney impudence
directed at the occupants of the cart.</p>

<p>They exhibited, too, what was perhaps even stranger&mdash;an
utter absence of any flaunting of courage or the smallest show of
defiance. What was this armour that looked like mere indifference?
It couldn't be that those quiet-looking young girls <i>were</i>
indifferent to the ordeal of standing up there before a crowd of
jeering rowdies whose less objectionable utterances were: 'Where
did you get that 'at?' 'The one in green is my girl!' 'Got yer
dog-whip, miss?' and such-like utterances.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The person thus pointedly alluded to left her companions ranged
along the side of the cart against the background of banner, while
she, the famous Miss Claxton, took the meeting in charge. She
wasted no time, this lady. Her opening remarks, which, in the
face of a fire of interruption, took the form of an attack upon the
Government, showed her an alert, competent, cut-and-thrust,
imperturbably self-possessed politician, who knew every aspect
of the history of the movement, as able to answer any intelligent
question off-hand as to snub an impudent irrelevance, able to take
up a point and drive it well in&mdash;to shrug and smile or frown and
point her finger, all with most telling effect, and keep the majority
of her audience with her every minute of the time.</p>

<p>As a mere exhibition of nerve it was a thing to make you open
your eyes. Only a moment was she arrested by either booing or
applause. When a knot of young men, who had pushed their
way near the front, kept on shouting argument and abuse, she
interrupted her harangue an instant. Pointing out the ring-leader&mdash;</p>

<p>'Now you be quiet, if you please,' she said. 'These people are
here to listen to <i>me</i>.'</p>

<p>'No, they ain't. They come to see wot you look like.'</p>

<p>'That can't be so,' she said calmly, 'because after they've seen
us they stay.' Then, as the interrupter began again, 'No, it's no
use, my man'&mdash;she shook her head gently as if almost sorry for
him&mdash;'you can't talk <i>me</i> down!'</p>

<p>'Now, ain't that just <i>like</i> a woman!' he complained to the
crowd.</p>

<p>Just in front of where Miss Levering and her satellite first came
to a standstill, was a cheerful, big, sandy man with long flowing
moustachios, a polo cap, and a very dirty collar. At intervals he
inquired of the men around him, in a great jovial voice, 'Are we
down-'earted?' as though the meeting had been called, not for
the purpose of rousing interest in the question of woman's share
in the work of the world, but as though its object were to humiliate
and disfranchise the men. But his exclamation, repeated at intervals,
came in as a sort of refrain to the rest of the proceedings.</p>

<p>'The Conservatives,' said the speaker, 'had never pretended
they favoured broadening the basis of the franchise. But here
were these Liberals, for thirty years they'd been saying that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>demand on the part of women for political recognition commanded
their respect, and would have their support, and yet there were
four hundred and odd members who had got into the House of
Commons very largely through the efforts of women&mdash;oh, yes,
we know all about that! We've been helping the men at elections
for years.'</p>

<p>'What party?'</p>

<p>Adroitly she replied, 'We have members of every party in our
ranks.'</p>

<p>'Are you a Conservative?'</p>

<p>'No, I myself am not a Conservative&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You work for the Labour men&mdash;I know!'</p>

<p>'It's child's play belonging to any party till we get the vote,'
she dismissed it. 'In future we are neither for Liberal nor Conservative
nor Labour. We are for Women. When we get the
sex bar removed, it will be time for us to sort ourselves into parties.
At present we are united against any Government that continues
to ignore its duty to the women of the country. In the past we
were so confiding that when a candidate said he was in favour of
Woman's Suffrage (he was usually a Liberal), we worked like
slaves to get that man elected, so that a voice might be raised for
women's interests in the next Parliament. Again and again the
man we worked for got in. But the voice that was to speak for
us&mdash;that voice was mute. We had served his purpose in helping
him to win his seat, and we found ourselves invariably forgotten
or ignored. The Conservatives have never shown the abysmal
hypocrisy of the Liberals. We can get on with our open enemies;
it's these <i>cowards</i>' ('Boo!' and groans)&mdash;'these cowards, I say&mdash;who,
in order to sneak into a place in the House, pretend to
sympathize with this reform&mdash;who use us, and then betray us;
it's these who are women's enemies!'</p>

<p>'Why are you always worrying the Liberals? Why don't you
ask the Conservatives to give you the vote?'</p>

<p>'You don't go to a person for something he hasn't got unless
you're a fool. The Liberals are in power; the Liberals were
readiest with fair promises; and so we go to the Liberals. And
we shall continue to go to them. We shall never leave off' (boos
and groans) 'till they leave office. Then we'll begin on the Conservatives.'
She ended in a chorus of laughter and cheers, 'I will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>now call upon Miss Cynthia Chisholm to propose the resolution.'</p>

<p>Wherewith the chairman gave way to the younger of the two
girls. This one of the Gracchi&mdash;a gentle-seeming creature, carelessly
dressed, grave and simple&mdash;faced the mob with evident
trepidation, a few notes, to which she never referred, in her shaking
hand. What brought a girl like that here?&mdash;was the question
on the few thoughtful faces in the crowd confronting her. She
answered the query by introducing the resolution in an earnest
little speech which, if it didn't show that much of the failure and
suffering that darken the face of the world is due to women's false
position, showed, at all events, that this young creature held a
burning conviction that the subjection of her sex was the world's
Root-Evil. With no apparent apprehension of the colossal audacity
of her position, the girl moved gravely that 'this meeting demands
of the Government the insertion of an enfranchisement clause in
the Plural Voting Bill, and demands that it shall become law during
the present session.' Her ignorance of Parliamentary procedure
was freely pointed out to her.</p>

<p>'No,' she said, 'it is you who are ignorant&mdash;of how pressing
the need is. You say it is "out of order." If treating the women
of the country fairly is out of order, it is only because men have
made a poor sort of order. It is the <i>order</i> that should be changed.'</p>

<p>Of course that dictum received its due amount of hooting.</p>

<p>'The vote is the reward for defending the country,' said a voice.</p>

<p>'No,' said the girl promptly, 'for soldiers and sailors don't
vote.'</p>

<p>'It implies fitness for military service,' somebody amended.</p>

<p>'It <i>shouldn't</i>,' said Nineteen, calmly; 'it ought to imply merely
<i>a stake</i> in the country. No one denies we have that.'</p>

<p>The crowd kept on about soldiering, till the speaker was goaded
into saying&mdash;</p>

<p>'I don't say women like fighting, but women <i>can</i> fight! In
these days warfare isn't any more a matter of great physical
strength, and a woman can pull a trigger as well as a man. The
Boer women found that out&mdash;and so has the Russian. I don't
like thinking about it myself&mdash;for I seem to realize too clearly
what horrors those women endured before they could carry bombs
or shoulder rifles.'</p>

<p>'Rifles? Why a woman can't never hit <i>nothing</i>.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>'It is quite true we can't most of us even throw a stone straight&mdash;the
great mass of women never in all their lives wanted to hit
anybody or anything. And that'&mdash;she came nearer, and leaned
over the side of the cart with scared face&mdash;'it's that that makes it
so dreadful to realize how at last when women's eyes are opened&mdash;when
they see their homes and the holiest things in life threatened
and despised, how quickly after all <i>they can learn the art of
war</i>.'</p>

<p>'With hatpins!' some one called out.</p>

<p>'Yes, scratching and spitting,' another added.</p>

<p>That sort of interruption did not so much embarrass her, but
once or twice she was nearly thrown off her beam-ends by men and
boys shouting, 'Wot's the matter with yer anyway? Can't yer
get a husband?' and such-like brilliant relevancies. Although
she flushed at some of these sallies, she stuck to her guns with a
pluck that won her friends. In one of the pauses a choleric old
man gesticulated with his umbrella.</p>

<p>'If what the world needed was Woman's Suffrage, it wouldn't
have been left for a minx like you to discover it.' At which volleys
of approval.</p>

<p>'That gentleman seems to think it's a new madness that we've
recently invented.' The child seemed in her loneliness to reach
out for companioning. She spoke of 'our friend John Stuart
Mill.'</p>

<p>'Oo's Mill?'</p>

<p>'That great Liberal wrote in 1867&mdash;&mdash;' But Mill and she were
drowned together. She waited a moment for the flood of derision
to subside.</p>

<p>'&rsquo;E wouldn't 'ad nothin' to do with yer if 'e'd thought you'd
go on like you done.'</p>

<p>'Benjamin Disraeli was on our side. Mazzini&mdash;Charles
Kingsley. As long ago as 1870, a Woman's Suffrage Bill that was
drafted by Dr. Pankhurst and Mr. Jacob Bright passed a second
<a name="Page_102t" id="Page_102t"></a><a href="#Page_102tn">reading.'</a></p>

<p>'The best sort of women <i>never</i> wanted it.'</p>

<p>'The kind of women in the past who cared to be associated with
this reform&mdash;they were women like Florence Nightingale, and
Harriet Martineau, and Josephine Butler, and the two thousand
other women of influence who memorialized Mr. Gladstone.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Something was called out that Vida could not hear, but that
brought the painful scarlet into the young face.</p>

<p>'Shame! shame!' Some of the men were denouncing the
interjection.</p>

<p>After a little pause the girl found her voice. 'You make it
difficult for me to tell you what I think you ought to know. I don't
believe I could go on if I didn't see over there the Reformer's
Tree. It makes me think of how much had to be borne before other
changes could be brought about.' She reminded the people of
what had been said and suffered on that very spot in the past, before
the men standing before her had got the liberties they enjoyed
to-day.</p>

<p>'They were <i>men</i>!'</p>

<p>'Yes, and so perhaps it wasn't so hard for them. I don't
know, and I'm sure it was hard enough. When we women remember
what <i>they suffered</i>&mdash;though you think meanly of us because
we can't be soldiers, you may as well know we are ready to
do whatever has to be done&mdash;we are ready to bear whatever has
to be borne. There seem to be things harder to face than bullets,
but it doesn't matter, they'll be faced.'</p>

<p>The lady standing with her maid in the incongruous crowd,
looked round once or twice with eyes that seemed to say, 'How
much stranger life is than we are half the time aware, and how
much stranger it bids fair to be!' The rude platform with the
scarlet backing flaming in the face of the glorious summer afternoon,
near the very spot upon which the great battles for Reform
had been fought out in the past, and in place of England's sturdy
freeman making his historic appeal for justice, and admission to the
Commons&mdash;a girl pouring out this stream of vigorous English,
upholding the cause her family had stood for. Her voice failed
her a little towards the close, or rather it did not so much fail as
betray to any sensitive listener the degree of strain she put upon it
to make it carry above laughter and interjection. As she raised
the note she bent over the crowd, leaning forward, with her neck
outstretched, the cords in it swelling, and the heat of the sun bringing
a flush and a moisture to her face, steadying her voice as the
thought of the struggle to come, shook and clouded it, and calling
on the people to judge of this matter without prejudice. It was a
thing to live in the memory&mdash;the vision of that earnest child trying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>to fire the London louts with the great names of the past, and failing
to see her bite her lip to keep back tears, and, bending over
the rabble, find a choked voice to say&mdash;</p>

<p>'If your forefathers and foremothers who suffered for the
freedom you young men enjoy&mdash;if they could come out of their
graves to-day and see how their descendants use the great privileges
they won&mdash;I believe they would go back into their graves and pull
the shrouds over their eyes to hide them from your shame!'</p>

<p>'Hear! Hear!' 'Right you are.'</p>

<p>But she was done. She turned away, and found friendly
hands stretched out to draw her to a seat.</p>

<p>The next speaker was an alert little woman with a provincial
accent and the briskness of a cock-sparrow, whose prettiness,
combined with pertness, rather demoralized the mob.</p>

<p>'Men and women,' she began, pitching her rather thin voice
several notes too high.</p>

<p>'Men and women!' some one piped in mimicry; and the crowd
dissolved in laughter.</p>

<p>It was curious to note again how that occasional exaggerated
shrillness of the feminine voice when raised in the open air&mdash;how
it amused the mob. They imitated the falsetto with squeals
of delight. Each time she began afresh she was met by the shrill
echo of her own voice. The contest went on for several minutes.
The spectacle of the agitated little figure, bobbing and gesticulating
and nothing heard but shrill squeaks, raised a very pandemonium
of merriment. It didn't mend matters for her to say when she did
get a hearing&mdash;</p>

<p>'I've come all the way from&mdash;&mdash;' (place indistinguishable in the
confusion) 'to talk to you this afternoon&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'&rsquo;ow kind!'</p>

<p>'Do you reely think they could spare you?'</p>

<p>'And I'm going to convert every man within reach of my voice.'</p>

<p>Groans, and 'Hear! Hear!'</p>

<p>'Let's see you try!'</p>

<p>She talked on quite inaudibly for the most part. A phrase
here and there came out, and the rest lost. So much hilarity
in the crowd attracted to it a bibulous gentleman, who kept calling
out, 'Oh, the pretty dear!' to the rapture of the bystanders. He
became so elevated that the police were obliged to remove him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
When the excitement attending this passage had calmed down, the
reformer was perceived to be still piping away.</p>

<p>'&rsquo;ow long are you goin' on like this?'</p>

<p>'Ain't you <i>never</i> goin' to stop?'</p>

<p>'Oh, not for a long time,' she shrilled cheerfully. 'I've got the
accumulations of <i>centuries</i> on me, and I'm only just beginning to
unload! Although we haven't got the vote&mdash;<i>not yet</i>&mdash;never
mind, we've got our tongues!'</p>

<p>'Lord, don't we know it!' said a sad-faced gentleman, in a rusty
topper.</p>

<p>'This one's too intolerable,' said a man to his companion.</p>

<p>'Yes; she ought to be smacked.'</p>

<p>They melted out of the crowd.</p>

<p>'We've got our tongues, and I've been going round among all
the women I know getting them to promise to <i>use</i> their
tongues&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You stand up there and tell us they needed <i>urgin'</i>?'</p>

<p>'To use their tongues to such purpose that it won't be women,
but <i>men</i>, who get up the next monster petition to Parliament asking
for Woman's <a name="Page_105t" id="Page_105t"></a><a href="#Page_105tn">Suffrage.'</a></p>

<p>She went down under a flood of jeers, and rose to the surface
again to say&mdash;</p>

<p>'A man's petition, praying Parliament for goodness' sake give
those women the vote! Yes, you'd better be seeing about that
petition, my friends, for I tell you there isn't going to be any
peace till we get the franchise.'</p>

<p>'Aw now, they'd give <i>you</i> anything!'</p>

<p>When the jeering had died a little, and she came to the top once
more, she was discovered to be shouting&mdash;</p>

<p>'You men 'ad just better keep an eye on us&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Can't take our eyes off yer!'</p>

<p>'We Suffragettes <i>never</i> have a Day of Rest! Every day in the
week, while you men are at work or sitting in the public-house,
we are visiting the women in their homes, explaining and stirring
them up to a sense of their wrongs.'</p>

<p>'This I should call an example of what <i>not</i> to say!' remarked
a shrewd-looking man with a grin.</p>

<p>The crowd were ragging the speaker again, while she
shouted&mdash;</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>'We are going to effect such a revolution as the world has never
seen!'</p>

<p>'I'd like to bash her head for her!'</p>

<p>'We let them know that so long as women have no citizenship
they are outside the pale of the law. If we are outside the law, we
can't <i>break</i> the law. It is not our fault that we're outlaws. It is
you men's fault.'</p>

<p>'Don't say that,' said a voice in mock agony. 'I love you
so.'</p>

<p>'I know you can't help it,' she retorted.</p>

<p>'If we gave you the vote, what would you do with it? Put it
in a pie?'</p>

<p>'Well, I wouldn't make the <i>hash</i> of it you men do!' and she
turned the laugh. 'Look at you! <i>Look</i> at you!' she said, when
quiet was restored.</p>

<p>The young revellers gave a rather blank snigger, as though they
had all along supposed looking at them to be an exhilarating occupation
for any young woman.</p>

<p>'What do you do with your power? You throw it away. You
submit to being taxed and to <i>our</i> being taxed to the tune of a
hundred and twenty-seven millions, that a war may be carried on
in South Africa&mdash;a war that most of you know nothing about
and care nothing about&mdash;a war that some of us knew only too
much about, and wanted only to see abandoned. We see constantly
how you men either misuse the power you have or you don't
use it at all. Don't appreciate it. Don't know what to do with it.
Haven't a notion you ought to be turning it into good for the world.
Hundreds of men don't care anything about political influence,
except that women shouldn't have it.'</p>

<p>She was getting on better till some one called out, 'You ought
to get married.'</p>

<p>'I'm going to. If you don't be good you won't be asked to the
wedding.'</p>

<p>Before the temptation of a retort she had dropped her argument
and encouraged personalities. In vain she tried to recover
that thread of attention which, not her interrupter, but herself had
snapped. She retired in the midst of uproar.</p>

<p>The chairman came forward and berated the crowd for its un-English
behaviour in not giving a speaker a fair hearing.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>A man held up a walking-stick. 'Will you just tell me one thing,
miss&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Not now. When the last speaker has finished there will be ten
minutes for questions. And I may say that it is a great and rare
pleasure to have any that are intelligent. Don't waste anything so
precious. Just save it up till you're asked for it. I want you now
to give a fair hearing to Mrs. Bewley.'</p>

<p>This was a wizened creature of about fifty, in rusty black, widow
of a stonemason and mother of four children&mdash;'four <i>livin'</i>,'
she said with some significance. She added her mite of testimony
to that of the 96,000 organized women of the mills, that the workers
in her way of life realized how their condition and that of the children
would be improved 'if the women 'ad some say in things.'</p>

<p>'It's quite certain,' she assured the people, 'there ought to be
women relief-officers and matrons in the prisons. And it's very
'ard on women that there isn't the same cheap lodgin'-'ouse accommodation
fur single women as there is fur single men. It's very
'ard on poor girls. It's worse than 'ard. But men won't never
change that. We women 'as got to do it.'</p>

<p>'Go 'ome and get your 'usban's tea!' said a new-comer, squeezing
her way into the tight-packed throng, a queer little woman
about the same age as the speaker, but dressed in purple silk and
velvet, and wearing a wonderful purple plush hat on a wig of sandy
curls. She might have been a prosperous milliner from the Commercial
Road, and she had a meek man along who wore the husband's
air of depressed responsibility. She was spared the humiliating
knowledge, but she was taken at first for a sympathizer
with the Cause. In manners she was precisely like what the Suffragette
was at that time expected to be, pushing her way through
the crowd, and vociferating 'Shyme!' to all and sundry. The men
who had been pleasantly occupied in boo-ing the speaker turned
and glared at her. The hang-dog husband had an air of not observing.
Some of the boys pushed and harried her, but, to their
obvious surprise, they heard her advising the rusty widow: 'Go
'ome and get your 'usban's tea!' She varied that advice by repeating
her favourite 'Shyme!' varied by 'Wot beayviour!&mdash;old
enough to know better. Every good wife oughter stay at 'ome and
darn 'er 'usban's socks and make 'im comftubble.'</p>

<p>After delivering which womanly sentiment she would nod her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>purple plumes and smile at the men. It was the sorriest travesty
of similar scenes in a politer world. To the credit of the loafers
about her, they did not greatly encourage her. She was perhaps
overmature for her <i>r&ocirc;le</i>. But they ceased to jostle her. They even
allowed her to get in front of them. The tall, rusty woman in the
cart was meanwhile telling a story of personal experience of the
operation of some law which shut out from any share in the benefits
of the new Act which regulates the feeding of school children, the
very people most in need of it. For it appeared that orphans and
the children of widows were excluded. The Bill provided only for
children living under their father's roof. If the roof was kept over
them by the shackled hands of the mother, according to the speaker,
they might go hungry.</p>

<p>'No, no,' Miss Levering shook her head, explaining to her maid.
'I don't doubt the poor soul has had some difficulty, some hard
experience, but she can't be quoting the law correctly.'</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the halting words of the woman who had suffered,
if only from misapprehension upon so grave a point, there
was a rude eloquence that overbore the lady's incredulity. The
crowd hissed such gross unfairness.</p>

<p>'If women 'ad 'ave made the laws, do you think we'd 'ave 'ad
one like that disgracin' the statue-book? No! And in all sorts o'
ways it looks like the law seems to think a child's got only one
parent. I'd like to tell them gentlemen that makes the laws that
(it may be different in their world, I only speak for my little corner
of it)&mdash;but in 'Ackney it looks like when a child's got only one
parent, that one is the mother.'</p>

<p>'Sy, let up, old gal! there's some o' them young ones ain't 'ad
a show yet.'</p>

<p>'About time you had a rest, mother!'</p>

<p>'If the mother dies,' she was saying, 'wot 'appens?'</p>

<p>'Let's 'ope she goes to heaven.'</p>

<p>'Wot 'appens to the pore little 'ome w'en the mother dies?
Why, the pore little home is sold up, and the children's scattered
among relations, or sent out so young to work it makes yer 'art
ache. But if a man dies&mdash;you see it on every side, <i>in 'Ackney</i>&mdash;the
widow takes in sewin', or goes out charin', or does other people's
washin' as well as 'er own, or she mykes boxes&mdash;<i>something</i>
er ruther, any'ow, that makes it possible fur 'er to keep 'er 'ome
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>together. You don't see the mother scatterin' the little family
w'en the only parent the law seems to reconize is dead and gone.
I say&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You've a been sayin' it for a good while. You must be needin'
a cup o' tea yerself.'</p>

<p>'In India I'm told they burn the widows. In England they do
worse than that. They keep them <i>half</i> alive.'</p>

<p>The crowd rose to that, with the pinched proof before their
eyes.</p>

<p>'Just enough alive to suffer through their children. And so
the workin' women round about where I live&mdash;that's 'Ackney&mdash;they
say if we ain't 'eathins in this country let's give up 'eathin
ways. Let the mothers o' this country 'ave their 'ands untied.
We're willin' to work for our children, but it breaks our 'earts to
work without tools. The tool we're needin' is the tool that mends
the laws. I 'ave pleasure in secondin' the resolution.'</p>

<p>With nervously twitching lips the woman sat down. They
cheered her lustily&mdash;a little out of sympathy, a good deal from
relief that she had finished, and a very different sort of person
was being introduced by the chairman.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>'I will now call upon the last speaker. Yes, I will answer
any general questions <i>after</i> Miss Ernestine Blunt has spoken.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I sy!'</p>

<p>'&rsquo;Ere's Miss Blunt.'</p>

<p>'Not that little one?'</p>

<p>'Yes. This is the one I was tellin' you about.'</p>

<p>People pushed and craned their necks, the crowd swayed as
the other one of the two youngest 'Suffragettes' came forward.
She had been sitting very quietly in her corner of the cart, looking
the least concerned person in Hyde Park. Almost dull the round
rather pouting face with the vivid scarlet lips; almost <a name="Page_110t" id="Page_110t"></a><a href="#Page_110tn">sleepy</a> the
heavy-lidded eyes. But when she had taken the speaker's post
above the crowd, the onlooker wondered why he had not noticed
her before.</p>

<p>It seemed probable that all save those quite new to the scene
had been keeping an eye on this person, who, despite her childish
look, was plainly no new recruit. Her self-possession demonstrated
that as abundantly as the reception she got&mdash;the vigorous
hoots and hoorays in the midst of clapping and cries&mdash;</p>

<p>'Does your mother know you're out?'</p>

<p>'Go 'ome and darn your stockens.'</p>

<p>'Hurrah!'</p>

<p>'You're a disgryce!'</p>

<p>'I bet on little Blunt!'</p>

<p>'Boo!'</p>

<p>Even in that portion of the crowd that did not relieve its feelings
by either talking or shouting, there was observable the indefinable
something that says, 'Now the real fun's going to begin.' You
see the same sort of manifestation in the playhouse when the
favourite comedian makes his entrance. He may have come on
quite soberly only to say, 'Tea is ready,' but the grin on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>face of the public is as ready as the tea. The people sit forward
on the edge of their seats, and the whole atmosphere of the theatre
undergoes some subtle change. So it was here.</p>

<p>And yet in this young woman was the most complete lack of any
dependence upon 'wiles' that platform ever saw. Her little off-hand
manner seemed to say, 'Don't expect me to encourage you
in any nonsense, and, above all, don't dare to presume upon my
youth.'</p>

<p>She began by calling on the Government to save the need of
further demonstration by giving the women of the country some
speedy measure of justice. 'They'll have to give it to us in the
end. They might just as well do it gracefully and at once as do
it grudgingly and after more "scenes."' Whereupon loud booing
testified to the audience's horror of anything approaching unruly
behaviour. 'Oh, yes, you are scandalized at the trouble we make.
But&mdash;I'll tell you a secret'&mdash;she paused and collected every eye
and ear&mdash;'<i>we've only just begun</i>! You'd be simply <i>staggered</i> if
you knew what the Government still has to expect from us, if
they don't give us what we're asking for.'</p>

<p>'Oh, ain't she just <i>awful</i>!' sniggered a girl with dyed hair and
gorgeous jewelry.</p>

<p>The men laughed and shook their heads. She just was! They
crowded nearer.</p>

<p>'You'd better take care! There's a policeman with 'is eye on
you.'</p>

<p>'It's on you, my friends, he's got his eye. You saw a little while
ago how they had to take away somebody for disturbing our meeting.
It wasn't a woman.'</p>

<p>'Hear, hear!'</p>

<p>'The police are our friends, when the Government allows them
to be. The other day when there was that scene in the House,
one of the policemen who was sent up to clear the gallery said he
wished the members would come and do their own dirty work.
They hate molesting us. We don't blame the police. We put the
blame where it belongs&mdash;on the Liberal Government.'</p>

<p>'Pore old Gov'mint&mdash;gettin' it 'ot.'</p>

<p>'Hooray fur the Gov'mint!'</p>

<p>'We see at last&mdash;it's taken us a long time, but we see at last&mdash;women
get nothing even from their professed political friends,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>they've nothing whatever to expect by waiting and being what's
called "ladylike."'</p>

<p>'Shame!'</p>

<p>'We don't want to depreciate the work of preparation the older,
the "ladylike," Suffrage women did, but we came at last to see
that all that was possible to accomplish that way had been done.
The Cause hadn't moved an inch for years. It was even doing the
other thing. Yes, it was going backward. Even the miserable
little pettifogging share women had had in Urban and Borough
Councils&mdash;even that they were deprived of. And they were
tamely submitting! Women who had been splendid workers ten
years ago, women with the best capacities for public service, had
fallen into a kind of apathy. They were utterly disheartened.
Many had given up the struggle. That was the state of affairs
with regard to Woman's Suffrage only a few short months ago.
We looked at the Suffragists who had grown grey in petitioning
Parliament and being constitutional and "ladylike," and we said,
"<i>That's no good.</i>"'</p>

<p>Through roars of laughter and indistinguishable denunciation
certain fragments rose clear&mdash;</p>

<p>'So you tried being a public nuisance!'</p>

<p>'A laughing-stock!'</p>

<p>'When we got to the place where we were a public laughing-stock
we knew we were getting on.' The audience screamed.
'<i>We began to feel encouraged!</i>' A very hurricane swept the
crowd. Perhaps it was chiefly at the gleam of eye and funny little
wag of the head with the big floppity hat that made the people
roar with delight. 'Yes; when things got to that point even the
worst old fogey in the Cabinet&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Name! Name!'</p>

<p>'No, we are merciful. We withhold the name!' She smiled
significantly, while the crowd yelled. 'Even the very fogeyest of
them all you'd think might have rubbed his eyes and said, "Everybody's
laughing at them&mdash;why, there must be something serious
at the bottom of this!" But no; the members of the present Government
<i>never</i> rub their eyes.'</p>

<p>'If you mean the Prime Minister&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Hooray for the&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Through the cheering you heard Ernestine saying, 'No, I <i>didn't</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
mean the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, between you and
me, is as good a Suffragist as any of us. Only he&mdash;&mdash;well, he
likes his comfort, does the Prime Minister!'</p>

<p>When Ernestine looked like that the crowd roared with laughter.
Yet it was impossible not to feel that when she herself smiled
it was because she couldn't help it, and not, singularly enough,
because of any dependence she placed upon the value of dimples
as an asset of persuasion. What she seemed to be after was to stir
these people up. It could not be denied that she knew how to do
it, any more than it could be doubted that she was ignorant of how
large a part in her success was played by a peculiarly amusing and
provocative personality. Always she was the first to be grave
again.</p>

<p>'Now if you noisy young men can manage to keep quiet for a
minute, I'll tell you a little about our tactics,' she said obligingly.</p>

<p>'We know! Breakin' up meetings!'</p>

<p>'<i>Rotten</i> tactics!'</p>

<p>'That only shows you don't understand them yet. Now I'll
explain to you.'</p>

<p>A little wind had sprung up and ruffled her hair. It blew open
her long plain coat. It even threatened to carry away her foolish
flapping hat. She held it on at critical moments, and tilted her
delicate little Greuze-like face at a bewitching angle, and all the
while that she was looking so fetching, she was briskly trouncing
by turns the Liberal party and the delighted crowd. The man
of the long moustachios, who had been swept to the other side of the
monument, returned to his old inquiry with mounting cheer&mdash;</p>

<p>'Are we down'earted? <i>Oh</i>, no!'</p>

<p>'Pore man! 'Ave a little pity on us, miss!'</p>

<p>There were others who edged nearer, narrowing their eyes and
squaring their shoulders as much as to say, 'Now we'll just trip
her up at the first opportunity.'</p>

<p>'That's a very black cloud, miss,' Gorringe had whispered
several minutes before a big raindrop had fallen on the lady's
upturned face.</p>

<p>As Gorringe seemed to be the only one who had observed the
overclouding of the sky, so she seemed to be the only one to think
it mattered much. But one by one, like some species of enormous
black 'four-o-clocks,' umbrellas blossomed above the undergrowth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>at the foot of the monument. The lady of the purple plumes had
long vanished. A few others moved off, head turned over shoulder,
as if doubtful of the policy of leaving while Ernestine was explaining
things. The great majority turned up their coat collars and
stood their ground. The maid hurriedly produced an umbrella
and held it over the lady.</p>

<p>'&rsquo;Igher up, please, miss! Caun't see,' said a youth behind.</p>

<p>Nothing cloudy about Ernestine's policy: Independence of all
parties, and organized opposition to whatever Government was in
power, until something was done to prove it that friend to women
it pretended to be.</p>

<p>'We are tired of being lied to and cheated. There isn't a man
in the world whose promise at election time I would trust!'</p>

<p>It struck some common chord in the gathering. They roared
with appreciation, partly to hear that baby saying it.</p>

<p>'No, not one!' she repeated stoutly, taking the raindrops in
her face, while the risen wind tugged at her wide hat. 'They'll
promise us heaven, and earth, and the moon, and the stars, just
to get our help. Oh, we are old hands at it now, and we can see
through the game!'</p>

<p>'Old 'and <i>she</i> is! Ha! ha! Old 'and!'</p>

<p>'Do they let you sit up for supper?'</p>

<p>'We are going to every contested election from this on.'</p>

<p>'Lord, yes! Rain or shine <i>they</i> don't mind!'</p>

<p>'They'll find they'll always have us to reckon with. And we
aren't <i>the least bit</i> impressed any more, when a candidate tells us
he's in favour of Woman's Suffrage. We say, "Oh, we've got four
hundred and twenty of your kind already!"'</p>

<p>'Oh! oh!'</p>

<p>'Haw! haw!'</p>

<p>'Oo did you say that to?'</p>

<p>By name she held up to scorn the candidates who had given every
reason for the general belief that they were indifferent, if not opposed,
to Woman's Suffrage till the moment came for contesting
a seat.</p>

<p>'Then when they find us there (we hear it keeps them awake at
night, thinking we always <i>will</i> be there in future!)&mdash;when they
find us there, they hold up their little white flags. Yes. And they
say, "Oh, but I'm in favour of Votes for Women!" We just smile.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The damp gathering in front of her hallooed.</p>

<p>'Yes. And when they protest what splendid friends of the
Suffrage they are, we say, "You don't care twopence about it.
You are like the humbugs who are there in the House of Commons
already."'</p>

<p>'Humbugs!'</p>

<p>'Calls 'em 'umbugs to their fyces! Haw! haw!'</p>

<p>Roars and booing filled the air.</p>

<p>'We know, for many of us helped to put them there. But that
was before we knew any better. <i>Never again!</i>'</p>

<p>Once more that wise little wag of the head, while the people
shrieked with laughter. It was highly refreshing to think those
Government blokes couldn't take in Ernestine.</p>

<p>'It's only the very young or the very foolish who will ever be
caught that way again,' she assured them.</p>

<p>'&rsquo;Ow old are you?'</p>

<p>'Much too old to&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Just the right age to think about gettin' married,' shouted a
pasty-faced youth.</p>

<p>'Haw! haw!'</p>

<p>Then a very penetrating voice screamed, 'Will you be mine?'
and that started off several others. Though the interruptions did
not anger nor in the least discompose this surprising young person
in the cart&mdash;so far at least as could be seen&mdash;the audience looked
in vain for her to give the notice to these that she had to other
interruptions. It began to be plain that, ready as she was to take
'a straight ball' from anybody in the crowd, she discouraged
impertinence by dint of an invincible deafness. If you wanted to get
a rise out of Ernestine you had to talk about her 'bloomin' policy.'
No hint in her of the cheap smartness that had wrecked the other
speaker. In that highly original place for such manifestation,
Ernestine offered all unconsciously a new lesson of the moral value
that may lie in good-breeding. She won the loutish crowd to listen
to her on her own terms.</p>

<p>'Both parties,' she was saying, 'have been glad enough to use
women's help to get candidates elected. We've been quite intelligent
enough to canvass for them; we were intelligent enough to
explain to the ignorant men&mdash;&mdash;' She acknowledged the groans
by saying, 'Of course there are none of that sort here, but elsewhere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>there are such things as ignorant men, and women by dozens and
by scores are sent about to explain to them why they should vote
this way or that. But as the chairman told you, any woman who
does that kind of thing in the future is a very poor creature. She
deserves no sympathy when her candidate forgets his pledge and
sneers at Womanhood in the House. If we put ourselves under
men's feet we must <i>expect</i> to be trodden on. We've come to think
it's time women should give up the door-mat attitude. That's
why we've determined on a policy of independence. We see how
well independence has worked for the Irish party&mdash;we see what
a power in the House even the little Labour party is, with only
thirty members. Some say those thirty Labour members lead the
great Liberal majority by the nose&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Hear! hear!'</p>

<p>'Rot!'</p>

<p>They began to cheer Lothian Scott. Some one tossed Mr.
Chamberlain's name into the air. Like a paper balloon it was kept
afloat by vigorous puffings of the human breath. '&rsquo;Ray fur Joe!'
'Three cheers for Joe!'&mdash;and it looked as if Ernestine had lost
them.</p>

<p>'Listen!' She held out her hands for silence, but the tumult
only grew. 'Just a moment. I want to tell you men&mdash;here's
a friend of yours&mdash;he's a new-comer, but he looks just your kind!
Give him a hearing.' She strained her voice to overtop the din.
'He's a <i>Liberal</i>.'</p>

<p>'Hooray!'</p>

<p>'Yes, I thought you'd listen to a Liberal. He's asking that old
question, Why did we wait till the Liberals came in? Why didn't
we worry the Conservatives when they were in power? The answer
to that is that the Woman's Suffrage cause was then still in
the stage of mild constitutional propaganda. Women were still
occupied in being ladylike and trying to get justice by deserving
it. Now wait a moment.' She stemmed another torrent. 'Be
quiet, while I tell you something. You men have taught us that
women can get a great deal by coaxing, often far more than we
deserve! But justice isn't one of the things that's ever got that
way. Justice has to be fought for. Justice has to be won.'</p>

<p>Howls and uproar.</p>

<p>'You men&mdash;&mdash;' (it began to be apparent that whenever the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>roaring got so loud that it threatened to drown her, she said, 'You
men&mdash;' very loud, and then gave her voice a rest while the din
died down that they might hear what else the irrepressible Ernestine
had to say upon that absorbing topic). 'You men discovered
years ago that you weren't going to get justice just by deserving it,
or even by being men, so when you got tired of asking politely for
the franchise, you took to smashing windows and burning down
Custom Houses, and overturning Bishops' carriages; while <i>we</i>,
why, we haven't so much as upset a curate off a bicycle!'</p>

<p>Others might laugh, not Ernestine.</p>

<p>'You men,' she went on, 'got up riots in the streets&mdash;<i>real</i> riots
where people lost their lives. It may have to come to that with us.
But the Government may as well know that if women's political
freedom has to be bought with blood, we can pay that price, too.'</p>

<p>Above a volley of boos and groans she went on, 'But we are
opposed to violence, and it will be our last resort. We are leaving
none of the more civilized ways untried. We publish a great
amount of literature&mdash;I hope you are all buying some of it&mdash;you
can't understand our movement unless you do! We organize
branch unions and we hire halls&mdash;we've got the Somerset Hall to-night,
and we hope you'll all come and bring your friends. We
have very interesting debates, and <i>we</i> answer questions, politely!'
she made her point to laughter. 'We don't leave any stone unturned.
Because there are people who don't buy our literature,
and who don't realize how interesting the Somerset Hall debates
are, we go into the public places where the idle and the foolish,
<i>like that man just over there!</i>&mdash;where they may point and laugh
and make their poor little jokes. But let me tell you we never hold
a meeting where we don't win friends to our cause. A lot of you
who are jeering and interrupting now are going to be among our
best friends. <i>All</i> the intelligent ones are going to be on our side.'</p>

<p>Above the laughter, a rich groggy voice was heard, 'Them that's
against yer are all drunk, miss' (hiccup). 'D&mdash;don't mind 'em!'</p>

<p>Ernestine just gave them time to appreciate that, and then went
on&mdash;</p>

<p>'Men and women were never meant to fight except side by side.
You've been told by one of the other speakers how the men suffer
by the women more and more underselling them in the Labour
market&mdash;&mdash;'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>'Don't need no tellin'.'</p>

<p>'Bloody black-legs!'</p>

<p>'Do you know how that has come about? I'll tell you. It's
come about through your keeping the women out of your Unions.
You never would have done that if they'd had votes. You saw
the important people ignored them. You thought it was safe for
you to do the same. But I tell you it <i>isn't ever</i> safe to ignore the
women!'</p>

<p>High over the groans and laughter the voice went on, 'You men
have got to realize that if our battle against the common enemy
is to be won, you've got to bring the women into line.'</p>

<p>'What's to become of chivalry?'</p>

<p>'What <i>has</i> become of chivalry?' she retorted; and no one
seemed to have an answer ready, but the crowd fell silent, like
people determined to puzzle out a conundrum.</p>

<p>'Don't you know that there are girls and women in this very
city who are working early and late for rich men, and who are expected
by those same employers to live on six shillings a week?
Perhaps I'm wrong in saying the men expect the women to live
on that. It may be they <i>know</i> that no girl can&mdash;it may be the
men know how that struggle ends. But do they care? Do <i>they</i>
bother about chivalry? Yet they and all of you are dreadfully
exercised for fear having a vote would unsex women. We are too
delicate&mdash;women are such fragile flowers.' The little face was
ablaze with scorn. 'I saw some of those fragile flowers last week&mdash;and
I'll tell you where. Not a very good place for gardening. It
was a back street in Liverpool. The "flowers"' (oh, the contempt
with which she loaded the innocent word!)&mdash;'the flowers looked
pretty dusty&mdash;but they weren't quite dead. I stood and looked
at them! hundreds of worn women coming down steep stairs and
pouring out into the street. What had they all been doing there
in that&mdash;garden, I was going to say!&mdash;that big grimy building?
They had been making cigars!&mdash;spending the best years of their
lives, spending all their youth in that grim dirty street making
cigars for men. Whose chivalry prevents that? Why were they
coming out at that hour of the day? Because their poor little
wages were going to be lowered, and with the courage of despair
they were going on strike. No chivalry prevents men from getting
women at the very lowest possible wage&mdash;(I want you to notice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>the low wage is the main consideration in all this)&mdash;men get these
women, that they say are so tender and delicate, to undertake the
almost intolerable toil of the rope-walk. They get women to
make bricks. Girls are driven&mdash;when they are not driven to
worse&mdash;they are driven to being lodging-house slaveys or over-worked
scullions. <i>That's</i> all right! Women are graciously permitted
to sweat over other people's washing, when they should be
caring for their own babies. In Birmingham'&mdash;she raised the
clear voice and bent her flushed face over the crowd&mdash;'in Birmingham
those same "fragile flowers" make bicycles to keep
alive! At Cradley Heath we make chains. At the pit brows we
sort coal. But a vote would soil our hands! You may wear out
women's lives in factories, you may sweat them in the slums, you
may drive them to the streets. You <i>do</i>. But a vote would unsex
them.'</p>

<p>Her full throat choked. She pressed her clenched fist against
her chest and seemed to admonish herself that emotion wasn't her
line.</p>

<p>'If you are intelligent you know as well as I do that women are
exploited the length and the breadth of the land. And yet you
come talking about chivalry! Now, I'll just tell you men something
for your future guidance.' She leaned far out over the crowd
and won a watchful silence. '<i>That talk about chivalry makes
women sick.</i>' In the midst of the roar, she cried, 'Yes, they mayn't
always show it, for women have had to learn to conceal their
deepest feelings, but depend on it that's how they feel.'</p>

<p>Then, apparently thinking she'd been serious enough, 'There
might be some sense in talking to us about chivalry if you paid our
taxes for us,' she said; while the people recovered their spirits in
roaring with delight at the coolness of that suggestion.</p>

<p>'If you forgave us our crimes because we are women! If you
gave annuities to the eighty-two women out of every hundred in
this country who are slaving to earn their bread&mdash;many of them
having to provide for their children; some of them having
to feed sick husbands or old parents. But chivalry doesn't
carry you men as far as that! No! No further than the door!
You'll hold that open for a lady and then expect her to grovel
before such an exhibition of <i>chivalry</i>! We don't need it, thank
you! We can open doors for ourselves.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>She had quite recovered her self-possession, and it looked, as
she faced the wind and the raindrops, as if she were going to wind
up in first-class fighting form. The umbrellas went down before
a gleam of returning sun. An aged woman in rusty black, who
late in the proceedings had timidly adventured a little way into
the crowd, stood there lost and wondering. She had peered about
during the last part of Miss Blunt's speech with faded incredulous
eyes, listened to a sentence or two, and then, turning with a pathetic
little nervous laugh of apology, consulted the faces of the Lords of
Creation. When the speaker was warned that a policeman had
his eye on her, the little old woman's instant solicitude showed that
the dauntless Suffragist had both touched and frightened her. She
craned forward with a fluttering anxiety till she could see for herself.
Yes! A stern-looking policeman coming slow and majestic
through the crowd. Was he going to hale the girl off to Holloway?
No; he came to a standstill near some rowdy boys, and
he stared straight before him&mdash;herculean, impassive, the very
image of conscious authority. Whenever Ernestine said anything
particularly dreadful, the old lady craned her neck to see how the
policeman was taking it. When Ernestine fell to drubbing the
Government, the old lady, in her agitation greatly daring, squeezed
up a little nearer as if half of a mind to try to placate that august
image of the Power that was being flouted. But it ended only in
trembling and furtive watching, till Ernestine's reckless scorn at the
idea of chivalry moved the ancient dame faintly to admonish the
girl, as a nurse might speak to a wilful child. 'Dear! <i>Dear!</i>'&mdash;and
then furtively trying to soothe the great policeman she twittered
at his elbow, 'No! No! she don't mean it!'</p>

<p>When Ernestine declared that women could open doors for
themselves, some one called out&mdash;</p>

<p>'When do you expect to be a K.C.?'</p>

<p>'Oh, quite soon,' she answered cheerfully, with her wind-blown
hat rakishly over one ear, while the boys jeered.</p>

<p>'Well,' said the policeman, 'she's pawsed 'er law examination!'
As some of the rowdiest boys, naturally surprised at this interjection,
looked round, he rubbed it in. 'Did better than the men,'
he assured them.</p>

<p>Was it possible that this dread myrmidon of the law was vaunting
the prowess of the small rebel?</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Levering moved nearer. 'Is that so? Did I understand
you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>With a surly face he glanced round at her. Not for this lady's
benefit had the admission been made.</p>

<p>'So they say!' he observed, with an assumption of indifference,
quite other than the tone in which he had betrayed where his
sympathies, in spite of himself, really were. Well, well, there were
all kinds, even of people who looked so much alike as policemen.</p>

<p>Now the crowd, with him and Miss Levering as sole exceptions,
were dissolved again in laughter. What had that girl been saying?</p>

<p>'Yes, we're spectres at the Liberal feast; and we're becoming
inconveniently numerous. We've got friends everywhere. Up
and down the country we go organizing&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'&rsquo;Ow do you go&mdash;in a pram?' At which the crowd rocked with
delight.</p>

<p>The only person who hadn't heard the sally, you would say,
was the orator. On she went&mdash;</p>

<p>'Organizing branches and carrying forward the work of propaganda.
You people in London stroll about with your hands in
your pockets and your hats on the back of your heads, and with
never a <i>notion</i> of what's going on in the world that thinks and
works. That's the world that's making the future. Some of you
understand it so little you think all that we tell you is a joke&mdash;just
as the governing class used to laugh at the idea of a Labour
Party in conservative England. While those people were laughing,
the Labour men were at work. They talked and wrote; they
lectured, and printed, and distributed, and organized, and one fine
day there was a General Election! To everybody's astonishment,
thirty Labour men were returned to Parliament! Just that same
sort of thing is going on now among women. We have our people
at work everywhere. And let me tell you, the most wonderful part
of it all is to discover how little teaching we have to do. How
<i>ready</i> the women are, all over the three kingdoms.'</p>

<p>'Rot!'</p>

<p>'The women are against it.'</p>

<p>'Read the letters in the papers.'</p>

<p>'Why don't more women come to hear you if they're so in
favour?'</p>

<p>'The converted don't need to come. It's you who need to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>come!' Above roars of derision: 'You felt that or, of course,
you wouldn't be here. Men are so reasonable! As to the women
who write letters to the papers to say they're against the Suffrage,
they are very ignorant, those ladies, or else it may be they write
their foolish letters to please their menfolk. Some of them, I
know, think the end and aim of woman is to please. I don't blame
them; it's the penalty of belonging to the parasite class. But those
women are a poor little handful. They write letters to prove that
they "don't count," and they <i>prove it</i>.' She waved them away
with one slim hand. 'That's one reason we don't bother much
with holding drawing-room meetings. The older Suffragists have
been holding drawing-room meetings <i>for forty years</i>!' She brought
it out to shouts. 'But we go to the mill gates! That's where we
hold our meetings! We hold them at the pit-brow; we hold
them everywhere that men and women are working and suffering
and hoping for a better time.'</p>

<p>With that Miss Ernestine sat down. They applauded her
lustily; they revelled in laughing praise, yielding to a glow that
they imagined to be pure magnanimity.</p>

<p>'Are there any questions?' Miss Claxton, with her eyes still
screwed up to meet the returning sun and the volley of interrogatory,
appeared at the side of the cart. 'Now, one at a time, please.
What? I can't hear when you all talk together. Write it down
and hand it to me. Now, you people who are nearer&mdash;what?
Very well! Here's a man who wants to know whether if women
had the vote wouldn't it make dissension in the house, when husband
and wife held different views?' She had smiled and nodded,
as though in this question she welcomed an old friend, but instead
of answering it she turned to the opposite side and looked out
over the clamourers on the left. They were engaged for the most
part in inquiring about her matrimonial prospects, and why she
had carried that dog-whip. Something in her face made them fall
silent, for it was both good-humoured and expectant, even intent.
'I'm waiting,' she said, after a little pause. 'At every meeting we
hold there's usually another question put at the same time as that
first one about the quarrels that will come of husbands and wives
holding different opinions. As though the quarrelsome ones had
been waiting for women's suffrage before they fell out! When the
man on my right asks, "Wouldn't they quarrel?" there's almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>always another man on my left who says, "If women were enfranchised
we wouldn't be an inch forrader, because the wife would
vote as her husband told her to. The man's vote would simply
be duplicated, and things would be exactly as they were." Neither
objector seems to see that the one scruple cancels the other. But
to the question put this afternoon, I'll just say this.' She bent
forward, and she held up her hand. 'To the end of time there'll
be people who won't rest till they've found something to quarrel
about. And to the end of time there'll be wives who follow blindly
where their husbands lead. And to the end of time there'll be husbands
who are influenced by their wives. What's more, all this
has gone on ever since there were husbands, and it will go on as
long as there are any left, and it's got no more to do with women's
voting than it has with their making cream tarts. No, not half
as much!' she laughed. 'Now, where's that question that you
were going to write?'</p>

<p>Some one handed up a wisp of white paper. Miss Claxton
opened it, and upon the subject presented she embarked with
the promising beginning, 'Your economics are pretty wobbly, my
friend,' and proceeded to clear the matter up and incidentally to
flatten out the man. One wondered that under such auspices
'Question Time' was as popular as it obviously was. There is no
doubt a fearful joy in adventuring yourself in certain danger before
the public eye. Besides the excitement of taking a personal share
in the game, there is always the hope that it may have been reserved
to you to stump the speaker and to shine before the multitude.</p>

<p>A gentleman who had vainly been trying to get her to hear him,
again asked something in a hesitating way, stumbling and going
back to recast the form of his question.</p>

<p>He was evidently quite in earnest, but either unaccustomed to
the sound of his own voice or unnerved to find himself bandying
words in Hyde Park with a Suffragette. So when he stuck fast
in the act of fashioning his phrases, Miss Claxton bent in the direction
whence the voice issued, and said, briskly obliging&mdash;</p>

<p>'You needn't go on. I know the rest. What this gentleman is
trying to ask is&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>And although no denial on his part reached the public ear, it
was not hard to imagine him seething with indignation, down there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>helpless in his crowded corner, while the facile speaker propounded
as well as demolished his objection to her and all her works.</p>

<p>'Yes; one last question. Let us have it.'</p>

<p>'How can you pretend that women want the vote? Why, there
are hardly any here.'</p>

<p>'More women would join us openly but for fear of their fellow-cowards.
Thousands upon thousands of women feel a sympathy
with this movement they dare not show.'</p>

<p>'Lots of women don't want the vote.'</p>

<p>'What women don't want it? Are you worrying about a handful
who think because they have been trained to like subservience
everybody else ought to like subservience, too? The very existence
of a movement like this is a thorn in their sleek sides. We are a
reproach and a menace to such women. But this isn't a movement
to compel anybody to vote. It is to give the right to those
who <i>do</i> want it&mdash;to those signatories of the second largest petition
ever laid on the table of the House of Commons&mdash;to the 96,000
textile workers&mdash;to the women who went last month in deputation
to the Prime Minister, and who represented over half a million
belonging to Trades Unions and organized societies. To&mdash;perhaps
more than all, to the unorganized women, those whose voices
are never heard in public. <i>They</i>, as Mrs. Bewley told you&mdash;they
are beginning to want it. The women who are made to work over
hours&mdash;<i>they</i> want the vote. To compel them to work over hours
is illegal. But who troubles to see that laws are fairly interpreted
for the unrepresented? I know a factory where a notice went up
yesterday to say that the women employed there will be required
to work twelve hours a day for the next few weeks. Instead of
starting at eight, they must begin at six, and work till seven. The
hours in this particular case are illegal&mdash;as the employer will
find out!' she threw in with a flash, and one saw by that illumination
the avenue through which his enlightenment would come.
'But in many shops where women work, twelve hours a day is
legal. Much of women's employment is absolutely unrestricted,
except that they may not be worked on Sunday. And while all
that is going on, comfortable gentlemen sit in armchairs and write
alarmist articles about the falling birth-rate and the horrible
amount of infant mortality. A Government calling itself Liberal
goes pettifogging on about side issues, while women are debased
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>and babies die. Here and there we find a man who realizes that
the main concern of the State should be its children, and that you
can't get worthy citizens where the mothers are sickly and enslaved.
The question of statecraft, rightly considered, always
reaches back to the mother. That State is most prosperous that
most considers her. No State that forgets her can survive. The
future is rooted in the well-being of women. If you rob the
women, your children and your children's children pay. Men
haven't realized it&mdash;your boasted logic has never yet reached so
far. Of all the community, the women who give the next generation
birth, and who form its character during the most impressionable
years of its life&mdash;of all the community, these mothers now or
mothers to be ought to be set free from the monstrous burden
that lies on the shoulders of millions of women. Those of you
who want to see women free, hold up your <a name="Page_125t" id="Page_125t"></a><a href="#Page_125tn">hands.'</a></p>

<p>A strange, orchid-like growth sprang up in the air. Hands
gloved and ungloved, hands of many shades and sizes, hands
grimy and hands ringed.</p>

<p>Something curious to the unaccustomed eye, these curling,
clutching, digitated members raised above their usual range and
common avocations, suddenly endowed with speech, and holding
forth there in the silent upper air for the whole human economy.</p>

<p>'Now, down.' The pallid growth vanished. 'Those against
the freedom of women.' Again hands, hands. Far too many to
suit the promoters of the meeting. But Miss Claxton announced,
'The ayes are in the majority. The meeting is with us.'</p>

<p>'She can't even count!' The air was full of the taunting phrase&mdash;'Can't
count!'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Miss Claxton, wheeling round again upon the people,
as some of her companions began to get down out of the cart.
'Yes, she can count, and she can see when men don't play fair.
Each one in that group held up <i>two</i> hands when the last vote was
taken.' She made a great deal of this incident, and elevated it into
a principle. 'It is entirely characteristic of the means men will
stoop to use in opposing the Women's Cause.'</p>

The raucous voice followed them, and not the voice alone. Through
the air was wafted the cheap and stifling scent of patchouli.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>Jean Dunbarton received Mr. Geoffrey Stonor upon his entrance
into Mrs. Freddy's drawing-room with a charming little
air of fluttered responsibility.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Freddy and I have been lunching with the Whyteleafes.
She had to go afterwards to say good-bye to some people who are
leaving for abroad. So Mrs. Freddy asked me to turn over my
Girls' Club to your cousin Sophia&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Are you given to good works, too?' he interrupted. 'What a
terribly philanthropic age it is!'</p>

<p>Jean smiled as she went on with her explanation. 'Although it
wasn't her Sunday, Sophia, like an angel, has gone to the club.
And I'm here to explain. Mrs. Freddy said if she wasn't back on
the stroke&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, I dare say I'm a trifle early.'</p>

<p>It was a theory that presented fewer difficulties than that he
should be kept waiting.</p>

<p>'I was to beg you to give her a few minutes' grace in any case.'</p>

<p>Instead of finding a seat, he stood looking down at the charming
face. His indifference to Mrs Freddy's precise programme lent
his eyes a misleading look of absent-mindedness, which dashed
the girl's obvious excitement over the encounter.</p>

<p>'I see,' he had said slowly. What he saw was a graceful creature
of medium height, with a clear colour and grey-blue eyes fixed
on him with an interest as eager as it was frank. What the grey-blue
eyes saw was probably some glorified version of Stonor's
straight, firm features, a little blunt, which lacked that semblance
of animation given by colour, and seemed to scorn to make up for
it by any mobility of expression. The grey eyes, set somewhat
too prominently, were heavy when not interested, and the claim to
good looks which nobody had dreamed of denying seemed to rest
mainly upon the lower part of his face. The lips, over-full, perhaps,
were firmly moulded, but the best lines were those curves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>from the ear to the quite beautiful chin. The gloss on the straight
light-brown hair may have stood to the barber's credit, but only
health could keep so much grace still in the carriage of a figure
heavier than should be in a man of forty&mdash;one who, without a
struggle, had declined from polo unto golf. There was no denying
that the old expression of incipient sullenness, fleeting or suppressed,
was deepening into the main characteristic of his face,
though it was held that he, as little as any man, had cause to present
that aspect to a world content to be his oyster. Yet, as no doubt
he had long ago learned, it was that very expression which was the
cause of much of the general concern people seemed to feel to
placate, to amuse, to dispel the menace of that cloud. The girl
saw it, and her heart failed her.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Freddy said if I told you the children were in the garden
expecting you, you wouldn't have the heart to go away directly.'</p>

<p>'She is right. I <i>haven't</i> the heart.' And in that lifting of his
cloud, the girl's own face shone an instant.</p>

<p>'I should have felt it a terrible responsibility if you were to go.'
She spoke as if the gladness that was not to be repressed called for
some explanation. 'Mrs. Freddy says that she and Mr. Freddy
see so little of you nowadays. That was why she made such a
point of my coming and trying to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You needed a great deal of urging then?' He betrayed the half-amused,
half-ironic surprise of the man accustomed to find people
ready enough, as a rule, to clutch at excuse for a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>. Although
she had flushed with mingled embarrassment and excitement,
he proceeded to increase her perturbation by suggesting,
'Mrs. Freddy had to overcome your dislike for the mission.'</p>

<p>'Dislike? Oh, no!'</p>

<p>'What then?'</p>

<p>'My&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;' She lifted her eyes, and dared to look him
full in the face as she said, 'I suppose you know you are rather
alarming.'</p>

<p>'Am I?' he smiled.</p>

<p>People less interested in him than Jean were grateful to Geoffrey
Stonor when he smiled. They felt relieved from some intangible
responsibility for the order of the universe.</p>

<p>The girl brightened wonderfully. 'Oh, yes, very alarming
indeed,' she assured him cheerfully.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>'How do you make that out?'</p>

<p>'I don't need to "make it out." It's so very plain.' Then a
little hastily, as if afraid of having said something that sounded
like impious fault-finding, 'Anybody's alarming who is so&mdash;so
much talked about, and so&mdash;well, like you, you understand.'</p>

<p>'I don't understand,' he objected mendaciously&mdash;'not a little
bit.'</p>

<p>'I think you must,' she said, with her candid air. 'Though I
had made up my mind that I wouldn't be afraid of you any more
since our week-end at Ulland.'</p>

<p>'Ah, that's better!'</p>

<p>There was nothing in the words, but in the gentleness with
which he brought them out, so much that the girl turned her eyes
away and played with the handle of her parasol.</p>

<p>'Have you been reading any more poetry?' he said.</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'No? Why not?'</p>

<p>She shook her head. 'It doesn't sound the same.'</p>

<p>'What! I spoilt it for you?'</p>

<p>She laughed, and again she shook her head, but with something
shy, half-frightened in her look. Nervously she dashed at a
diversion.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I was a little misleading about the children. They
aren't in the garden yet. Shall we go up and see them having tea?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no, it would be bad for their little digestions to hurry
them.'</p>

<p>He sat down. Her face gave him as much credit as though he
had done some fine self-abnegating deed.</p>

<p>They spoke of that Sunday walk in the valley below the Ulland
links, and the crossing of a swollen little stream on a rotting and
rickety log.</p>

<p>'I <i>had</i> to go,' she explained apologetically. 'Hermione had
gone on and forgotten the puppy hadn't learnt to follow. I was
afraid he'd lose himself.'</p>

<p>'It <i>was</i> a dangerous place to go across,' he said, as if to justify
some past opinion.</p>

<p>Her eyes were a little mischievous. 'I never thought <i>you'd</i>
come.'</p>

<p>'Why?' he demanded.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh, because I thought you'd be too&mdash;&mdash;' His slow look
quickened as if to surprise in her some reflection upon his too solid
flesh&mdash;or might it even be upon the weight of years? But the
uncritical admiration in her face must have reassured him before
the words, 'I thought you'd be too grand. It was delightful to
find you weren't.'</p>

<p>He kept his eyes on her. 'Are you always so happy?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I hope not. That would be rather too inhuman, wouldn't
it?'</p>

<p>'Too celestial, perhaps!' He laughed&mdash;but he was looking
into the blue of her eyes as if through them he too had caught a
glimpse of Paradise. 'I remember thinking at Ulland,' he said
more slowly again, 'I had never seen any one quite so happy.'</p>

<p>'I was happy at Ulland. But I'm not happy now.'</p>

<p>'Then your looks belie you.'</p>

<p>'No, I am very sad. I have to go away from this delightful
London to Scotland. I shall be away for weeks. It's too dismal.'</p>

<p>'Why do you go?'</p>

<p>'My grandfather makes me. He hates London. And his
dreary old house on a horrible windy hill&mdash;he simply loves that!'</p>

<p>'And you don't love it <i>at all</i>. I see.' He seemed to be thinking
out something.</p>

<p>Compunction visited the face before him. 'I didn't mean to
say I didn't love it <i>at all</i>. It's like those people you care to be with
for a little while, but if you must go being with them for ever you
come to hate them&mdash;almost.'</p>

<p>They sat silent for a moment, then with slow reflectiveness, like
one who thinks aloud, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>'I have to go to Scotland next week.'</p>

<p>'Do you! What part?'</p>

<p>'I go to Inverness-shire.'</p>

<p>'Why, that's where we are! Near&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why shouldn't I drop down upon you some day?'</p>

<p>'Oh, <i>will</i> you? That would be&mdash;&mdash;' She seemed to save
herself from some gulf of betrayal. 'There are walks about my
grandfather's more beautiful than anything you ever saw&mdash;or
perhaps I ought to say more beautiful than anything <i>I</i> ever saw.'</p>

<p>'Nicer walks than at Ulland?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no comparison! One is a bridle-path all along a wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>ful
brown trout stream that goes racing down our hill. There's
a moor on one side, and a wood on the other, and a peat bog at
the bottom.'</p>

<p>'We might perhaps stop short of the bog.'</p>

<p>'Yes, we'd stop at old McTaggart's. He's the head-keeper and
a real friend. McTaggart "has the Gaelic." But he hasn't
much else, so perhaps you'd prefer his wife.'</p>

<p>'Why should I prefer his wife?'</p>

<p>Jean's face was full of laughter. Stonor's plan of going to
Scotland had singularly altered the character of that country.
Its very inhabitants were now perceived to be enlivening even to
talk about; to <i>know</i>&mdash;the gamekeeper's wife alone&mdash;would repay
the journey thither.</p>

<p>'I assure you Mrs. McTaggart is a travelled, experienced person.'</p>

<p>He shook his head while he humoured her. 'I'm not sure travel
or experience is what we chiefly prize&mdash;in ladies.'</p>

<p>'Oh, isn't it? I didn't know, you see. I didn't know how
dreadfully you might miss the terribly clever people you're accustomed
to in London.'</p>

<p>'It's because of the terribly clever people we are glad to go
away.'</p>

<p>He waxed so eloquent in his admiration of the womanly woman
(who seemed by implication to have steered clear of Mrs. McTaggart's
pitfalls), that Jean asked with dancing eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>'Are you consoling me for not being clever?'</p>

<p>'Are you sure you aren't?'</p>

<p>'Oh, dear, yes. No possible shadow of doubt about it.'</p>

<p>'Then,' he laughed, 'I'm coming to Inverness-shire! I'll even
go so far as to call on the McTaggarts if you'll undertake that she
won't instruct me about foreign lands.'</p>

<p>'No such irrelevance! She'd tell you about London. She was
here for six whole months. And she got something out of it I
don't believe even you have. A Certificate of Merit.'</p>

<p>'No. London certainly never gave me one.'</p>

<p>'You see! Mrs. McTaggart lived the life of the Metropolis
with such success that she passed an examination before she left.
The subject was: "Incidents in the Life of Abraham." It says
so on the certificate. She has it framed and hung in the parlour.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>He smiled. 'I admit few can point to such fruits of Metropolitan
Ausbildung. But I think I shall prefer the burnside&mdash;or
even the bog.'</p>

<p>'No; the moors. They're best of all.' She sat looking straight
before her, with her heart's deep well overflowing at her eyes. As
if she felt vaguely that some sober reason must be found for seeing
those same moors in this glorified light all of a sudden, she went
on, 'I'll show you a special place where white heather grows, and
the rabbits tumble about as tame as kittens. It's miles away from
the sea, but the gulls come sunning themselves and walking about
like pigeons. I used to hide up there when I was little and
naughty. Nobody ever found the place out except an old gaberlunzie,
and I gave him tuppence not to tell.'</p>

<p>'Yes, show me that place.' His face was wonderfully attractive
so!</p>

<p>'And we'll take The Earthly&mdash;William Morris&mdash;along, won't
we?'</p>

<p>'I thought you'd given up reading poetry.'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;to myself. I used to think I knew about poetry, yes,
better than anybody but the poets. There are people as arrogant
as that.'</p>

<p>'Why, it's worse than Mrs. McTaggart!'</p>

<p>The girl was grave, even tremulous. 'But, no! I never had a
notion of what poetry really was till down at Ulland you took my
book away from me, and read aloud&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mr. Freddy let himself and Lord Borrodaile in at the front door
so closely on the heels of Mrs. Freddy that the servant who had
closed the door behind her had not yet vanished into the lower
regions. At a word from that functionary, Mr. Freddy left his
brother depositing hat and stick with the usual deliberation, and
himself ran upstairs two steps at a time. He caught up with his
wife just outside the drawing-room door, as she paused to take
off her veil in front of that mirror which Mrs. Freddy said should
be placed between the front door and the drawing-room in every
house in the land for the reassurance of the timid feminine creature.
She was known to add privately that it was not ignored by
men&mdash;and that those who came often, contracted a habit of hurry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>ing
upstairs close at the servant's heels, in order to have two
seconds to spare for furtive consultation, while he went on to open
the drawing-room door. She had observed this pantomime more
than once, leaning over the banisters, herself on the way downstairs.</p>

<p>'They tell me Stonor's been here half an hour,' said Mr. Freddy,
breathlessly. 'You're dreadfully late!'</p>

<p>'No, darling&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He held out his watch to confound her. 'You tell me you aren't
late?'</p>

<p>'Sh&mdash;no. I do so sympathize with a girl who has no mother,'
with which enigmatic rejoinder she pushed open the door, and
went briskly through the double drawing-room to where Mr.
Geoffrey Stonor and Jean Dunbarton were sitting by a window
that overlooked the square.</p>

<p>Stonor waved away Mrs. Freddy's shower of excuses, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>'You've come just in time to save us from falling out. I've been
telling Miss Dunbarton that in another age she would have been
a sort of Dinah Morris, or more likely another St. Ursula with a
train of seven thousand virgins.'</p>

<p>'And all because I've told him about my Girls' Club! and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, '"and"&mdash;&mdash;' He turned away and shook hands
with his two kinsmen. He sat talking to them with his back to
the girl.</p>

<p>It was a study in those delicate weights and measures that go to
estimating the least tangible things in personality, to note how his
action seemed not only to dim her vividness but actually to efface
the girl. In the first moments she herself accepted it at that. Her
looks said: He is not aware of me any more&mdash;ergo, I don't exist.</p>

<p>During the slight distraction incident to the bringing in of tea,
and Mr. Freddy's pushing up some of the big chairs, Mr. Stonor
had a moment's remembrance of her. He spoke of his Scottish
plans and fell to considering dates. Then all of a sudden she saw
that again and yet more woundingly his attention had wandered.
The moment came while Lord Borrodaile was busy Russianizing
a cup of tea, and Mr. Freddy, balancing himself on very wide-apart
legs in front of his wife's tea-table, had interrogated her&mdash;</p>

<p>'What do you think, shall I ring and say we aren't at home?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps it would be&mdash;&mdash;' Mrs. Freddy's eye flying back from
Stonor caught her brother-in-law's. 'Freddy'&mdash;she arrested
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>her husband as he was making for the bell&mdash;'say, "except to Miss
Levering."'</p>

<p>'All right. Except to Miss Levering.' And it was at that point
that Jean saw she wasn't being listened to.</p>

<p>Even Mrs. Freddy, looking up, was conscious of something in
Stonor's face that made her say&mdash;</p>

<p>'Old Sir Hervey's youngest daughter. You knew <i>him</i>, I suppose,
even if you haven't met her. Jean, you aren't giving Mr.
Stonor anything to eat.'</p>

<p>'No, no, thanks. I don't know why I took this.' He set down
his tea-cup. 'I never have tea.'</p>

<p>'You're like everybody else,' said the girl, in a half-petulant
aside.</p>

<p>'Does nobody have tea?'</p>

<p>She lowered her voice while the others discussed who had already
been sent away, and who might still be expected to invade.</p>

<p>'Nobody remembers anybody else when that Miss Levering of
theirs is to the fore. You began to say when&mdash;to talk about
Scotland.'</p>

<p>He had taken out his watch. 'I was wondering if the children
were down yet. Shall we go and see?'</p>

<p>Jean jumped up with alacrity.</p>

<p>'Sh!' Mrs. Freddy held up a finger and silenced her little circle.
'They must have thought I was ringing for toast&mdash;somebody's
being let in!'</p>

<p>'Let's hope it's Miss Levering,' said Mr. Freddy.</p>

<p>'I must see those young barbarians of yours before I go,' said
Stonor, rising with decision.</p>

<p>The sound of voices on the stair was quite distinct now. By
the time the servant had opened the door and announced: 'Mrs.
Heriot, Miss Heriot, Captain Beeching,' Mr. Freddy, the usually
gracious host, was leading the way through the back drawing-room,
unblushingly abetting Mr. Stonor's escape under the very eyes of
persons who would have gone miles on the chance of meeting him.</p>

<p>Small wonder that Jean was consoled for knowing herself too
shy to follow, if she remembered that he had actually asked her
to do so! She showed no surprise at the tacit assumption on the
part of his relations that Geoffrey Stonor could never be expected
to sit there as common mortals might, making himself more or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>less agreeable to whoever might chance to drop in. Unless they
were 'very special' of course he couldn't be expected to put up
with them.</p>

<p>But what on earth was happening! No wonder Mrs. Freddy
looked aghast. For Mrs. Heriot had had the temerity to execute
a short cut and waylay the escaping lion. 'Oh, how do you do?'&mdash;she
thrust out a hand. And he went out as if she had been thin
air! It was the kind of insolence that used to be more common,
because safer, than it is likely to be in future&mdash;a form of condoned
brutality that used to inspire more awe than disgust. People were
guilty even of a slavish admiration of those who had the nerve to
administer this wholly disproportionate reproof to the merely maladroit.
It could be done only by one whom all the world had
conspired to befog and befool about his importance in the scheme
of things.</p>

<p>Small wonder the girl, too, was bewildered. For no one seemed
to dream of resenting what had occurred. The lesson conveyed
appeared to be that the proper attitude to certain of your fellow-creatures
was very much the traditional one towards royalty.
You were not to speak unless you were spoken to. And yet this
man who with impunity snubbed persons of consideration, was the
same one who was coming to call on Sally McTaggart&mdash;he was
going to walk the bridle-path along the burnside to the white
heather haven.</p>

<p>With the dazed look in her eyes, and cheeks scarlet with sympathy
and confusion, the girl had run forward to greet her aunt,
and to do her little share toward dissipating the awkward chill
that had fallen on the company.</p>

<p>After producing a stammered, 'Oh&mdash;a&mdash;I thought it was&mdash;&mdash;'
the immediate effect on Mrs. Heriot was to make her both furious
and cowed. Though a nervous stream of talk trickled on, Mrs.
Freddy's face did not lose its flustered look nor did the company
regain its ease, until a further diversion was created by the appearance
of Miss Levering with an alert, humorous-looking man of
middle-age in her train.</p>

<p>'Mr. Greatorex was passing just in time to help me out of my
hansom,' was her greeting to Mrs. Freddy.</p>

<p>'And I,' said the gentleman, 'insisted on being further rewarded
by being brought in.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>'<i>That</i> is Miss Levering?' whispered Jean, partly to distract her
aunt.</p>

<p>'Yes; why not?' said Lord Borrodaile, overhearing.</p>

<p>'Oh, I somehow imagined her different.'</p>

<p>'She <i>is</i> different,' said Aunt Lydia, with bitter gloom. 'You
would never know in the least what she was like from the look of
her.'</p>

<p>Lord Borrodaile's eyes twinkled. 'Is that so?' he said, indulgent
to a mood which hardly perhaps made for dispassionate
appraisement.</p>

<p>'You don't believe it!' said Mrs. Heriot. 'Of course not!'</p>

<p>'I was only thinking what a fillip it gave acquaintance to be in
doubt whether a person was a sinner or a saint.'</p>

<p>'It wouldn't for me,' said Jean.</p>

<p>'Oh, you see, you're so Scotch.'</p>

<p>He was incorrigible!</p>

<p>'I didn't hear, who is the man?' Jean asked, as those not knowing
usually did.</p>

<p>Although far from distinguished in appearance, Mr. Greatorex
would have stood in no danger of being overlooked, even if he had
not those twinkling jewel-like eyes, and two strands of coal-black
hair trained across his large bumpy cranium, from the left ear to
the right, and securely pasted there.</p>

<p>'It's that wretched radical, St. John Greatorex.' Mrs. Heriot
turned from her niece to Lord Borrodaile. 'What foundation is
there,' she demanded, 'for the rumour that he tells such good stories
at dinner? <i>I</i> never heard any.'</p>

<p>'Ah, I believe he keeps them till the ladies have left the room.'</p>

<p>'You don't like him, either,' said Mrs. Heriot, reaching out for
the balm of alliance with Lord Borrodaile.</p>

<p>But he held aloof. 'Oh, they say he has his points&mdash;a good
judge of wine, and knows more about Parliamentary procedure
than most of us.'</p>

<p>'How you men stand up for one another! You know perfectly
well you can't endure him.' Mrs. Heriot jerked her head away
and faced the group round the tea-table. 'What is she saying?
That she's been to a Suffrage meeting in Hyde Park!'</p>

<p>'How could she! Nothing would induce me to go and listen to
such people!' said Miss Dunbarton.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Her eyes, as well as Mrs. Heriot's, were riveted on the tall figure,
tea-cup in hand, moving away from the table now to make room
for some new arrivals, and drawing after her a portion of the company,
including Lady Whyteleafe and Richard Farnborough, who
one after another had come in a few moments before. It was to
the young man that Greatorex was saying, with a twinkle, 'I am
sure Mr. Farnborough agrees with me.'</p>

<p>Slightly self-conscious, he replied, 'About Miss Levering being
too&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'For that sort of thing altogether "too."'</p>

<p>'How do you know?' said the lady herself, with a teasing smile.</p>

<p>Greatorex started out of the chair in which he had just deposited
himself at her side. 'God bless my soul!' he said.</p>

<p>'She's only saying that to get a rise out of you.' Farnborough
seemed unable to bear the momentary shadow obscuring the
lady's brightness.</p>

<p>'Ah, yes'&mdash;Greatorex leaned back again&mdash;'your frocks aren't
serious enough.'</p>

<p>'Haven't I been telling you it's an exploded notion that the Suffrage
people are all dowdy and dull?'</p>

<p>'Pooh!' said Mr. Greatorex.</p>

<p>'You talk about some of them being pretty,' Farnborough said.
'<i>I</i> didn't see a good-looking one among 'em.'</p>

<p>'Ah, you men are so unsophisticated; you missed the fine
feathers.'</p>

<p>'Plenty o' feathers on the one I heard.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but not <i>fine</i> feathers. A man judges of the general
effect. We can, at a pinch, see past unbecoming clothes, can't we,
Lady Whyteleafe? We see what women could make of themselves
if they took the trouble.'</p>

<p>'All the same,' said the lady appealed to, 'it's odd they don't
see how much better policy it would be if they <i>did</i> take a little
trouble about their looks. Now, if we got our maids to do those
women's hair for them&mdash;if we lent them our French hats&mdash;ah,
<i>then</i>'&mdash;Lady Whyteleafe nodded till the pear-shaped pearls in
her ears swung out like milk-white bells ringing an alarum&mdash;'they'd
convert you creatures fast enough then.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps "convert" is hardly the word,' said Vida, with ironic
mouth. As though on an impulse, she bent forward to say, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>her lips near Lady Whyteleafe's pearl drop: 'What if it's the aim
of the movement to get away from the need of just these little
dodges?'</p>

<p>'Dodges?'</p>

<p>But without the exclamation, Miss Levering must have seen that
she had been speaking in an unknown tongue. A world where
beauty exists for beauty's sake&mdash;which is love's sake&mdash;and not
for tricking money or power out of men, even the possibility of
such a world is beyond the imagining of many.</p>

<p>Something was said about a deputation of women who had
waited on Mr. Greatorex.</p>

<p>'Hm, yes, yes.' He fiddled with his watch chain.</p>

<p>As though she had just recalled the circumstances, 'Oh, yes,'
Vida said, 'I remember I thought at the time, in my modest way,
it was nothing short of heroic of them to go asking audience of their
arch opponent.'</p>

<p>'It didn't come off!' He wagged his strange head.</p>

<p>'Oh,' she said innocently, 'I thought they insisted on bearding the
lion in his den.'</p>

<p>'Of course I wasn't going to be bothered with a lot of&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You don't mean you refused to go out and face them!'</p>

<p>He put on a comic look of terror. 'I wouldn't have done it for
worlds! But a friend of mine went and had a look at 'em.'</p>

<p>'Well,' she laughed,'did he get back alive?'</p>

<p>'Yes, but he advised me not to go. "You're quite right,"
he said. "Don't you think of bothering," he said. "I've looked
over the lot," he said, "and there isn't a week-ender among 'em."'</p>

<p>Upon the general laugh that drew Hermione and Captain Beeching
into the group, Jean precipitated herself gaily into the conversation.
'Have they told you about Mrs. Freddy's friend who came
to tea here in the winter?' she asked Hermione. 'He was a
member of Parliament, too&mdash;quite a little young one&mdash;he said
women would never be respected till they had the vote!'</p>

<p>Mr. Greatorex snorted, the other men smiled, and all the
women, except Aunt Lydia, did the same.</p>

<p>'I remember telling him,' Mrs. Heriot said, with marked severity,
'that he was too young to know what he was talking about.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I'm afraid you all sat on the poor gentleman,' said Lord
Borrodaile.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>'It was such fun. He was flat as a pancake when we'd done with
him. Aunt Ellen was here. She told him with her most distinguished
air she didn't want to be respected.'</p>

<p>'Dear Lady John!' murmured Miss Levering. 'I can hear
her!'</p>

<p>'Quite right,' said Captain Beeching. 'Awful idea to think
you're <i>respected</i>.'</p>

<p>'Simply revolting,' agreed Miss Heriot.</p>

<p>'Poor little man!' laughed Jean, 'and he thought he was being
<i>so</i> agreeable!'</p>

<p>'Instead of which it was you.'</p>

<p>Miss Levering said the curious words quite pleasantly, but so
low that only Jean heard them.</p>

<p>The girl looked up. 'Me?'</p>

<p>'You had the satisfaction of knowing you had made yourself
immensely popular with all other men.'</p>

<p>The girl flushed. 'I hope you don't think I did it for that
reason.'</p>

<p>The little passage was unnoticed by the rest of the company,
who were listening to Lord Borrodaile's contented pronouncement:
'I'm afraid the new-fangled seed falls on barren ground in our old-fashioned
gardens&mdash;<i>pace</i> my charming sister-in-law.'</p>

<p>Greatorex turned sharply. 'Mrs. Tunbridge! God bless my
soul, you don't mean&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'There is one thing I will say for her'&mdash;Mrs. Freddy's brother-in-law
lazily defended the honour of the house&mdash;'she doesn't,
as a rule, obtrude her opinions. There are people who have known
her for years, and haven't a notion she's a light among the misguided.'</p>

<p>But Greatorex was not to be reassured. 'Mrs. Tunbridge!
Lord, the perils that beset the feet of man!' He got up with a
half-comic ill humour.</p>

<p>'You're not going!' The hostess flitted over to remonstrate.
'I haven't had a word with you.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; I'm going.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Freddy looked bewildered at the general laugh.</p>

<p>'He's heard aspersions cast upon your character,' said Lord
Borrodaile. 'His moral sense is shocked.'</p>

<p>'Honestly, Mrs. Tunbridge'&mdash;Farnborough was for giving her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>a chance to clear herself&mdash;'what do you think of your friends'
recent exploits?'</p>

<p>'My friends?'</p>

<p>'Yes; the disorderly women.'</p>

<p>'They are not my friends,' said Mrs. Freddy, with dignity,
'but I don't think you must call them&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why not?' said Lord Borrodaile. '<i>I</i> can forgive them for
worrying the Liberals'&mdash;he threw a laughing glance at Greatorex&mdash;'but
they <i>are</i> disorderly.'</p>

<p>'Isn't the phrase consecrated to a different class?' said Miss
Levering, quietly.</p>

<p>'You're perfectly right.' Greatorex, for once, was at one with
Lord Borrodaile. 'They've become nothing less than a public
nuisance. Going about with dog-whips and spitting in policemen's
faces.'</p>

<p>'I wonder,' said Mrs. Freddy, with a harassed air&mdash;'I wonder
if they did spit!'</p>

<p>'Of course they did!' Greatorex exulted.</p>

<p>'You're no authority on what they do,' said Mrs. Freddy.
'You run away.'</p>

<p>'Run away?' He turned the laugh by precipitately backing
away from her in a couple of agitated steps. 'Yes, and if ever I
muster up courage to come back, it will be to vote for better manners
in public life, not worse than we have already.'</p>

<p>'So should I,' observed Mrs. Freddy, meekly. 'Don't think I
defended the Suffragettes.'</p>

<p>'But still,' said Miss Levering, with a faint accent of impatience,
'you <i>are</i> an advocate for the Suffrage, aren't you?'</p>

<p>'I don't beat the air.'</p>

<p>'Only policemen,' Greatorex mocked.</p>

<p>'If you cared to know the attitude of the real workers in the
Reform,' Mrs. Freddy said plaintively, 'you might have seen in any
paper that we lost no time in dissociating ourselves from the two
or three hysterical&mdash;&mdash;' She caught her brother-in-law's critical
eye, and instantly checked her flow of words.</p>

<p>There was a general movement as Greatorex made his good-byes.
Mrs. Heriot signalled her daughter.</p>

<p>In the absence of the master, Lord Borrodaile made ready to do
the honours of the house to a lady who had had so little profit of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>her visit. Beeching carried off the reluctant Farnborough. Mrs.
Freddy kept up her spirits until after the exodus; then, with a sigh,
she sat down beside Vida. 'It's true what that old cynic says,'
she admitted sorrowfully. 'The scene has put back the Reform
a generation.'</p>

<p>'It must have been awfully exciting. I wish I'd been there,'
said Jean.</p>

<p>'I <i>was</i> there.'</p>

<p>'Oh, was it as bad as the papers said?'</p>

<p>'Worse. I've never been so moved in public&mdash;no tragedy,
no great opera ever gripped an audience as the situation in the
House did that night. There we all sat breathless&mdash;with everything
more favourable to us than it had been within the memory of
woman. Another five minutes and the resolution would have
passed. Then&mdash;all in a moment'&mdash;Mrs. Freddy clasped her
hands excitedly&mdash;'all in a moment a horrible, dingy little flag
was poked through the grille of the Woman's Gallery&mdash;cries&mdash;insults&mdash;scuffling&mdash;the
police&mdash;the ignominious turning out
of the women&mdash;<i>us</i> as well as the&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I can't <i>think</i> of it
without&mdash;&mdash;' She jumped up and walked to and fro. 'Then the
next morning!' She paused. 'The people gloating. Our friends
antagonized&mdash;people who were wavering&mdash;nearly won over&mdash;all
thrown back! Heart-breaking! Even my husband! Freddy's
been an angel about letting me take my share when I felt I must&mdash;but,
of course, I've always known he doesn't like it. It makes
him shy. I'm sure it gives him a horrid twist inside when he sees
even the discreetest little paragraph to say that I am "one of the
speakers." But he's always been an angel about it before this.
After the disgraceful scene, he said, "It just shows how unfit
women are for any sort of coherent thinking or concerted
action."'</p>

<p>'To think,' said Jean, more sympathetically, 'that it should be
women who've given their own scheme the worst blow it ever had!'</p>

<p>'The work of forty years destroyed in five minutes!'</p>

<p>'They must have felt pretty sick,' said the girl, 'when they
waked up the next morning&mdash;those Suffragettes.'</p>

<p>'I don't waste any sympathy on <i>them</i>. I'm thinking of the penalty
<i>all</i> women have to pay because two or three hysterical&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Still, I think I'm sorry for them,' the girl persisted. 'It must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>be dreadful to find you've done such a lot of harm to the thing
you care most about in the world.'</p>

<p>'Do you picture the Suffragettes sitting in sack-cloth?' said
Vida, speaking at last.</p>

<p>'Well, they can't help realizing <i>now</i> what they've done.'</p>

<p>'Isn't it just possible they realize they've waked up interest in
the Woman Question so that it's advertised in every paper, and discussed
under every roof, from Land's End to John-o'-Groats?
Don't you think <i>they</i> know there's been more said and written
about it in these days since the scene than in the ten years
before it!'</p>

<p>'You aren't saying you think it was a good way to get what they
wanted!' exclaimed Mrs. Freddy.</p>

<p>'I'm only pointing out that it seems not such a bad way to get
it known they <i>do</i> want something, and&mdash;"want it bad,"' Vida
added, smiling.</p>

<p>Jean drew her low chair almost in front of the lady who had so
wounded her sensibilities a little while before with that charge of
popularity-hunting.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Tunbridge says before that horrid scene everything was
favourable at last,' the girl hazarded.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Mrs. Freddy, 'we never had so many friends in the
House before&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'"Friends,"' echoed the other woman, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>'Why do you say it like that?'</p>

<p>'Because I was thinking of a funny story&mdash;(he <i>said</i> it was
funny)&mdash;a Liberal Whip told me the other day. A Radical
member went out of the House after his speech in favour of the
Women's Bill, and as he came back half an hour later he heard
some members talking in the lobby about the astonishing number
who were going to vote for the measure. And the Friend of
Woman dropped his jaw and clutched the man next him. "My
God!" he said, "you don't mean they're going to <i>give</i> it to them!"'</p>

<p>'Sh! Here is Ronald.' Mrs. Freddy's tact brought her smiling
to her feet as the figure of her brother-in-law appeared in the
doorway. But she turned her back on him and affected absorption
in the tableau presented by Jean leaning forward, elbow on
knee, chin in hand, gazing steadily in Vida Levering's face.</p>

<p>'I don't want to interrupt you two,' said the hostess, 'but I
think you must look at the pictures.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh, yes, I brought them specially'&mdash;Lord Borrodaile deflected
his course in order to take up from the table two squares of
cardboard tied face to face with tape.</p>

<p>'Bless the man!' Mrs. Freddy contemplated him with smiling
affectation of scorn. 'I mean the new photographs of the children.
He's thinking of some reproductions Herbert Tunbridge
got while he was abroad&mdash;pictures of things somebody's unearthed
in Sicily or Cyprus.'</p>

<p>'Crete, my dear.' He turned his back on the fond mother
and Jean who was already oh-ing with appreciation at the first of
a pile of little Saras and Cecils. When he came back to his corner
of the sofa he made no motion to undo his packet, but 'Now then!'
he said, as he often did on sitting down beside Vida Levering&mdash;as
though they had been interrupted on the verge of coming to an
agreement about something.</p>

<p>She, with an instinct of returning the ball, usually tossed at him
some scrap of news or a jest, or some small social judgment.
This time when he uttered his 'Now then,' with that anticipatory
air, she answered instantly&mdash;'Yes; something rather odd has
been happening. I've been seeing beyond my usual range.'</p>

<p>'Really!' He smiled at her with a mixture of patronage and
affection. 'And did you find there was "something new under
the sun" after all?'</p>

<p>'Well, perhaps not so new, though it seemed new to me. But
something differently looked at. Why do we pretend that all
conversion is to some religious dogma&mdash;why not to a view of life?'</p>

<p>'Bless my soul! I begin to feel nervous.'</p>

<p>'Do you remember once telling me that I had a thing that was
rare in my sex&mdash;a sense of humour?'</p>

<p>'I remember often thinking it,' he said handsomely.</p>

<p>'It wasn't the first time I'd heard that. And it was one of the
compliments I liked best.'</p>

<p>'We all do. It means we have a sense of proportion&mdash;the
mental suppleness that is capable of the ironic view; an eye that
can look right as well as left.'</p>

<p>She nodded. 'When you wrote to me once, "My dear Ironist,"
I&mdash;yes&mdash;I felt rather superior. I'm conscious now that it's
been a piece of hidden, intellectual pride with me that I could smile
at most things.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well, do you mean to forswear pride? For you can't live
without smiling.'</p>

<p>'I've seen something to-day that I don't feel I want to smile at.
And yet to you it's the most ludicrous spectacle in London.'</p>

<p>'This is all very mysterious.' He turned his long, whimsical
face on one side as he settled himself more comfortably against the
cushion.</p>

<p>'You heard why I was late?' she said.</p>

<p>'I took the liberty of doubting the reason you gave!'</p>

<p>'You mustn't. It wasn't even my first offence.'</p>

<p>'You must find time hang very heavy on your hands.'</p>

<p>'On the contrary. I've never known the time to go so fast.
Oh, heaps of people would do what I have, if they only knew how
queer and interesting it is, and how already the outer aspect of the
thing is changing. At the first meetings very few women of any
class. Now there are dozens&mdash;scores. Soon there'll be hundreds.
There were three thousand people in the park this afternoon,
so a policeman told me, but hardly any of the class that what
Dick Farnborough calls "runs England."'</p>

<p>'I suppose not.'</p>

<p>'You don't even know yet you'll have to deal with all that
passionate feeling, all that fixed determination to bring about a
vast, far-reaching change!&mdash;a change so great&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That it would knock civilized society into a cocked hat.'</p>

<p>'I wonder.'</p>

<p>'You <i>wonder</i>?'</p>

<p>'I wonder if you oughtn't to be reassured by the&mdash;bigness of the
thing. It isn't only these women in Hyde Park. They have
a Feministe Movement in France. They say there's a Frauenbewegung
in Germany. From Finland to Italy&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, strikes and uprisings. It's an uneasy Age.'</p>

<p>'People in India wanting a greater share in the government&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Mad as the Persians&mdash;&mdash;' he smiled&mdash;'fancy <i>Persians</i> clamouring
for a representative chamber! It's a sort of epidemic.'</p>

<p>'The Egyptians, too, restless under "benefits." And now everywhere,
as if by some great concerted movement&mdash;the Women!'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; there's plenty of regrettable restlessness up and down
the world, a sort of wave of revolt against the constituted authorities.
If it goes too far&mdash;nothing for us but a military despotism!'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>She shook her head with a look of such serene conviction that
he persisted, 'I'd be sorry if we came to it&mdash;but if this spirit grows,
this rebellion against all forms of control&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, no, against other people's control. Suppose it ends in
people learning self-control.'</p>

<p>'That's the last thing the masses can do. There are few, even
of the <i>&eacute;lite</i>, who have ever done it, and they belong to the Moral
Aristocracy&mdash;the smallest and most rigid in the world. This
thing that you're just opening your eyes to, is the rage against restraint
that goes with decadence. But the phlegmatic Englishman
won't lead in that d&eacute;gringolade.'</p>

<p>'You mean we won't be among the first of the great nations to give
women the Suffrage?'</p>

<p>'<i>England?</i>' The slow head-shake and the smile airily relegated
the Woman's Movement to the limbo of the infinitely distant.</p>

<p>'Just because the men won't have it?' and for the second time
she said, 'I wonder. For myself, I rather think the women are
going to win.'</p>

<p>'Not in my time. Not even in yours.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'Oh, the men will never let it come to the point.'</p>

<p>'It's interesting to hear you say that. You justify the militant
women, you know.'</p>

<p>'That is perhaps <i>not</i> to hit the bull's eye!' he said, a little
grimly. Then dropping his unaccustomed air of chill disapproval,
he appealed to his friend's better taste. A confession of sheer
physical loathing crept into his face as he let fall two or three little
sentences about these women's offence against public decorum.
'Why, it is as hideous as war!' he wound up, dismissing it.</p>

<p>'Perhaps it <i>is</i> war.' Her phrase drew the cloud of menace down
again; it closed about them. It seemed to trouble her that he
would not meet her gaze. 'Don't think&mdash;&mdash;' she prayed, and
stumbling against the new hardness in his face, broke off, withdrew
her eyes and changed the form of what she had meant to say.
'I think I like good manners, too, but I see it would be a mistake to
put them first. What if we have to earn the right to be gentle and
gracious without shame?'</p>

<p>'You seriously defend these people!'</p>

<p>'I'm not sure they haven't taken the only way.' She looked at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>her friend with a fresh appeal in her eyes. But his were wearing
their new cold look. She seemed to nerve herself to meet some
numbing danger of cowardice. 'The old rule used to be patience&mdash;with
no matter what wrong. The new feeling is: shame on
any one who weakly suffers wrong! Isn't it too cheap an idea of
morals that women should take credit for the enduring that keeps
the wrong alive? You won't say women have no stake in morals.
Have we any right to let the world go wrong while we get compliments
for our forbearance and for pretty manners?'</p>

<p>'You began,' said Borrodaile, 'by explaining other women's
notions. You have ended by seeming to adopt them as your own.
But you are a person of some intelligence. You will open your
eyes before you go too far. You belong to the people who are
responsible for handing on the world's treasure. As we've agreed,
there never was a time when it was attacked from so many sides.
Can't you see what's at stake?'</p>

<p>'I see that many of the pleasantest things may be in eclipse for
a time.'</p>

<p>'My dear, they would die off the face of the earth.'</p>

<p>'No, they are too necessary.'</p>

<p>'To you and me. Not to the brawlers in Hyde Park. The life
of civilized beings is a very complex thing. It isn't filled by good
intentions nor even by the cardinal virtues. The function of the
older societies is to hand on the best things the world has won,
so that those who come after, instead of having to go back to barbarism,
may start from where the best of their day left off. We
do for manners and the arts in general what the Moors did for
learning when the wild hordes came down. There were capital
chaps among the barbarians,' he smiled, 'I haven't a doubt! But
it was the men who held fast to civilization's clue, they were the
people who mattered. <i>We</i> matter. We hold the clue.' He was
recovering his spirits. 'Your friends want to open the gates still
wider to the Huns. You want even the Moors overwhelmed.'</p>

<p>'Many women are as jealous to guard the old gains as the
men are. Wait!' She leaned forward. 'I begin to see! They
are more keen about it than the mass of men. The women!
They are civilization's only ally against your brother, the
Goth.'</p>

<p>He laughed. 'When you are as absurd as that, my dear, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>don't mind. No, not a little bit. And I really believe I'm too
fond of you to quarrel on any ground.'</p>

<p>'You don't care enough about anything to quarrel about it,'
she said, smiling, too. 'But it's just as well'&mdash;she rose and began
to draw on her glove&mdash;'just as well that each of us should know
where to find the other. So tell me, what if it should be a question
of going forward in the suffrage direction or going back?'</p>

<p>'You mean&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'&mdash;&mdash;on from latchkeys and University degrees to Parliament,
or back.'</p>

<p>'Oh, back,' he said hastily. 'Back. Yes, back to the harem.'</p>

<p>When the words were out, Lord Borrodaile had laughed a little
uneasily&mdash;like one who has surprised even himself by some too-illuminating
avowal. 'See here,' he put out a hand. 'I'm not
going to let you go for a minute or two. I've brought something
to show you. This foolish discussion put it out of my head.'
But the revealing word he had flung out&mdash;it seemed to have struck
wide some window that had been shuttered close before. The
woman stood there in the glare. She did not refuse to be drawn
back to her place on the sofa, but she looked round first to see if
the others had heard and how they took it. A glimpse of Mrs.
Freddy's gown showed her out of earshot on the balcony.</p>

<p>'I've got something here really rather wonderful,' Lord Borrodaile
went on, with that infrequent kindling of enthusiasm. He
had taken one of the unmounted photographs from between its
two bits of cardboard and was holding it up before his eyeglass.
'Yes, he's an extraordinary beggar!'&mdash;which remark in the ears
of those who knew his lordship, advertized his admiration of either
some man of genius or 'Uebermensch' of sorts. Before he shared
the picture with his companion he told her of what was not then so
widely known&mdash;details of that most thrilling moment perhaps in
all the romance of arch&aelig;ology&mdash;where the excavators of Knossos
came upon the first authentic picture of a man belonging to that
mysterious and forgotten race that had raised up a civilization in
some things rivalling the Greek&mdash;a race that had watched Minoan
power wane and die, and all but the dimmest legend of it vanish,
before the builders of Argos and Mycen&aelig; began laying their foundation
stones. Borrodaile, with an accent that for him was almost
emotion, emphasized the strangeness to the scholar of having to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>abandon the old idea of the Greek being the sole flower of Mediterranean
civilization. For here was this wonderful island folk&mdash;a
people standing between and bridging East and West&mdash;these
Cretan men and women who, though they show us their faces,
their delicate art and their stupendous palaces, have held no parley
with the sons of men, some say for three and thirty centuries.
'But wait! They'll tell us tales before those fellows have done!
I wouldn't mind hearing what this beggar has to say for himself!'
At last he shared the picture. They agreed that he was a beggar
to be reckoned with&mdash;this proud athlete coming back to the world
of men after his long sleep, not blinded by the new day, not primitive,
apologetic, but meeting us with a high imperial mien, daring
and beautiful.</p>

<p>'What do you suppose he is carrying in that vase?' Vida asked;
'or is that some trophy?'</p>

<p>'No, no, it's the long drinking cup&mdash;to the expert eye that is
added evidence of his high degree of civilization. But <i>think</i>, you
know, a man like that walking the earth so long before the Greeks!
And here. This courtly train looking on at the games. What do
you say to the women!'</p>

<p>'Why, they had got as far as flouncing their gowns and puffing
their sleeves! Their hair!'&mdash;'Dear me, they must have had a
M. Raoul to ondul&eacute; and dress it.' 'Amazing!&mdash;was there ever
anything so modern dug out of the earth before?' 'No, nothing
like it!' he said, holding the pictures up again between the glass
and his kindling eye. 'Ce sont vraiment des Parisiennes!'</p>

<p>Over his shoulder the modern woman looked long at that
strange company. 'It is nothing less than uncanny,' she said
at last. 'It makes one vaguely wretched.'</p>

<p>'What does?'</p>

<p>'To realize that so long ago the world had got so far. Why
couldn't people like these go further still? Why didn't their sons
hold fast what so great a race had won?'</p>

<p>'These things go in cycles.'</p>

<p>'Isn't that a phrase?'&mdash;the woman mused&mdash;'to cover our
ignorance of how things go&mdash;and why? Why should we be so
content to go the old way to destruction? If I were "the English"
of this splendid specimen of a Cretan, I would at least find a new
way to perdition.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>'Perhaps we shall!'</p>

<p>They sat trying from the accounts of Lord Borrodaile's arch&aelig;ological
friends to reconstruct something of that vanished
world. It was a game they had played at before, with Etruscan
vases and ivories from Ephesus&mdash;the man bringing to it his
learning and his wit, the woman her supple imagination and a passion
of interest in the great romance of the Pilgrimage of
Man.</p>

<p>But to-day she bore a less light-hearted part&mdash;'It all came
to an end!' she repeated.</p>

<p>'Well, so shall we.'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;we&mdash;<i>you</i> will leave your like behind to "hold fast to
the clue," as you said a little while ago.'</p>

<p>'Till the turn of the wheel carries the English down. Then
somewhere else on our uneasy earth men will begin again&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'&mdash;&mdash;the fruitless round! But it's horrible&mdash;the waste of
effort in the world! It's worse than horrible. It's insane.'
She looked up suddenly into his face. 'You are wise. Tell me
what you think the story of the world means, with its successive
clutches at civilization&mdash;all those histories of slow and painful
building&mdash;by Ganges and by Nile and in the Isles of Greece.'</p>

<p>'It's a part of the universal rhythm that all things move
to&mdash;Nature's way,' he answered.</p>

<p>'Or was it because of some offence against one of her high
laws that she wiped the old experiments out? What if the meaning
of history is that an Empire maintained by brute force shall
perish by brute force!'</p>

<p>'Ah,' he fixed her with those eyes of his. 'I see where you
are going.'</p>

<p>'You can't either of you go anywhere,' said Mrs. Freddy,
appearing through the balcony window, 'till you've seen the
children's pictures.' Vida's eye had once more fallen on the
reproduction of one of the Cretan frescoes with a sudden intensification
of interest.</p>

<p>'What is it?' Borrodaile asked, looking over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Woman-like she offered the man the outermost fringe of her
thought. 'Even Lady Whyteleafe,' she said, 'would be satisfied
with the attention they paid to their hair.'</p>

<p>'Come, you two.' Mrs. Freddy was at last impatient. 'Jean's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>got the <i>really</i> beautiful pictures, showing them to Geoffrey. Let
us all go down to help him to decide which is the best.'</p>

<p>'Geoffrey?'</p>

<p>'Geoffrey Stonor&mdash;you know him, of course. But nobody
knows the very nicest side of Geoffrey, do they?' she appealed
to Borrodaile,&mdash;'nobody who hasn't seen him with children?'</p>

<p>'I never saw him with children,' said Vida, buttoning the last
button of her glove.</p>

<p>'Well, come down and watch him with Sara and Cecil. They
perfectly adore him.'</p>

<p>'No, it's too late.'</p>

<p>But the fond mother drew her friend to the window. 'You
can see them from here.'</p>

<p>Vida was not so hurried, apparently, but what she could stand
there taking in the picture of Sara and Cecil climbing about their
big, kind cousin, with Jean and Mr. Freddy looking on.</p>

<p>'Children!' Their mother waved a handkerchief. 'Here's
another friend! Chil&mdash;&mdash; They're too absorbed to notice,'
she said apologetically, turning to find Vida had left the window,
and was saying good-bye to Borrodaile.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' he agreed, 'they won't care about anybody else while
Geoffrey is there.' Lord Borrodaile stooped and picked up
a piece of folded paper off the sofa. 'Did I drop that?' He
opened it. '<i>Votes for</i>&mdash;&mdash;' He read the two words out in an
accent that seemed to brand them with foolishness, even with
vulgarity. 'No, decidedly I did not drop it.'</p>

<p>He was conveying the sheet to the wastepaper basket as one
who piously removes some unsavoury litter out of the way of those
who walk delicately. Miss Levering arrested him with outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>'Do you want it?' His look adjured her to say, 'No.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I want it.'</p>

<p>'What for?' he persisted.</p>

<p>'I want it for an address there is on it.'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>It was Friday, and Mrs. Fox-Moore was setting out to alleviate
the lot of the poor in Whitechapel.</p>

<p>'Even if it were not Friday,' Vida said slyly as her sister was
preparing to leave the house, 'you'd invent some errand to take
you out of the contaminated air of Queen Anne's Gate this afternoon.'</p>

<p>'Well, as I told you,' said the other woman, nervously, 'you
ask that person here on your own responsibility.'</p>

<p>Vida smiled. 'I'm obliged to ask people here if I want to see
them quietly. You make such a fuss when I suggest having
a house of my own!'</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox-Moore ignored the alternative. 'You'll see you're
only making trouble for yourself. You'll have to pay handsomely
for your curiosity.'</p>

<p>'Well, I've been rather economical of late. Maybe I'll be able
"to pay."'</p>

<p>'Don't imagine you'll be able to settle an account of that kind
with a single cheque. Give people like that an inch, and they'll
expect a weekly ell.'</p>

<p>'Are you afraid she'll abstract the spoons?'</p>

<p>'I'm not only afraid, I <i>know</i> she won't be satisfied with one
contribution, or one visit. She'll regard it as the thin end of the
wedge&mdash;getting her nose into a house of this kind.' Irresistibly
the words conjured up a vision of some sharp-visaged female
marauder insinuating the tip of a very pointed nose between the
great front door and the lintel. 'I only hope,' the elder woman
went on, 'that I won't be here the first time Donald encounters
your new friend on the doorstep. <i>That's</i> all!'</p>

<p>Wherewith she departed to succour women and children at
long range in the good old way. Little Doris was ill in bed.
Mr. Fox-Moore was understood to have joined his brother's
coaching party. The time had been discreetly chosen&mdash;the
coast was indubitably clear. But would it remain so?</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>To insure that it should, Miss Levering had a private conference
with the butler.</p>

<p>'Some one is coming to see me on business.'</p>

<p>'Yes, miss.'</p>

<p>'At half-past five.'</p>

<p>'Yes, miss.'</p>

<p>'I specially don't want to be interrupted.'</p>

<p>'No, miss.'</p>

<p>'Not by <i>any</i>body, no matter whom.'</p>

<p>'Very well, miss.' A slight pause. 'Shall I show the gentleman
into the drawing-room, miss?'</p>

<p>'It's not a gentleman, and I'll see her upstairs in my sitting-room.'</p>

<p>'Yes, miss. Very well, miss.'</p>

<p>'And don't forget&mdash;to <i>any</i> one else I'm not at home.'</p>

<p>'No, miss. What name, miss?'</p>

<p>Vida hesitated. The servants nowadays read everything.
'Oh, you can't make a mistake. She&mdash;&mdash; It will be a stranger&mdash;some
one who has never been here before. Wait! I'll look
out of the morning-room window. If it is the person I'm expecting,
I'll ring the bell. You understand. If the morning-room
bell has rung just as this person comes, it will be the one I'm
expecting.'</p>

<p>'Yes, miss.' With a splendid impassivity in the face of precautions
so unprecedented, the servant withdrew.</p>

<p>Vida smiled to herself as she leaned back among the cushions
of her capacious sofa, cutting the pages of a book. A pleasant
place this room of hers, wide and cool, where the creamy background
of wall and chintz-cover was lattice-laced with roses.
The open windows looked out upon one of those glimpses of
greenery made vivid to the London eye, not alone by gratitude,
but by contrast of the leafage against the ebonized bark of smoke-ingrained
bole and twig.</p>

<p>The summer wind was making great, gentle fans of the plane
branches; it was swaying the curtains that hung down in long,
straight folds from the high cornices. No other sound in the
room but the hard grate of the ivory paper-knife sawing its way
through a book whose outside alone (a muddy-brown, pimpled
cloth) proclaimed it utilitarian. Among the fair-covered Italian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>volumes, the vellum-bound poets, and those friends-for-a-lifetime
wearing linen or morocco to suit a special taste; above all, among
that greater company 'quite impudently French' that stood
close ranked on shelves or lay about on tables&mdash;the brown book
on its dusty modern theme wore the air of a frieze-coated yeoman
sitting amongst broadcloth and silk. The reader glanced from
time to time at the clock. When the small glittering hand on the
porcelain face pointed to twenty minutes past five, the lady took
her book and her paper-knife into a front room on the floor below.
She sat down behind the lowered persienne, and every now and
then lifted her eyes from the page and peered out between the
tiny slits. As the time went on she looked out oftener. More
than once she half rose and seemed about to abandon all hope
of the mysterious visitor when a hansom dashed up to the door.
One swift glance: 'They go in cabs!'&mdash;and Miss Levering ran
to the bell.</p>

<p>A few moments after, she was again established in her sofa
corner, and the door of her sitting-room opened. 'The lady,
miss.' Into the wide, harmonious space was ushered a hot and
harassed-looking woman, in a lank alpaca gown and a tam-o'-shanter.
Miss Claxton's clothes, like herself, had borne the heat
and burden of the day. She frowned as she gave her hand.</p>

<p>'I am late, but it was very difficult to get away at all.'</p>

<p>Miss Levering pushed towards her one of the welcoming great
easy-chairs that stood holding out cool arms and a lap of roses.
The tired visitor, with her dusty clothes and brusque manner,
sat down without relaxing to the luxurious invitation. Her
stiffly maintained attitude and direct look said as plain as print,
Now what excuse have you to offer for asking me to come here?
It may have been recollection of Mrs. Fox-Moore's fear of 'the
thin end of the wedge' that made Miss Levering smile as she said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes, I've been expecting you for the last half hour, but it's
very good of you to come at all.'</p>

<p>Miss Claxton looked as if she quite agreed.</p>

<p>'You'll have some tea?' Miss Levering was moving towards
the bell.</p>

<p>'No, I've had my tea.'</p>

<p>The queer sound of 'my' tea connoting so much else! The
hostess subsided on to the sofa.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>'I heard you speak the other day as I told you in my note. But
all the same I came away with several unanswered questions&mdash;questions
that I wanted to put to you quietly. As I wrote you,
I am not what <i>you</i> would call a convert. I've only got as far as
the inquiry stage.'</p>

<p>Miss Claxton waited.</p>

<p>'Still, if I take up your time, I ought not to let you be out
of pocket by it.'</p>

<p>The hostess glanced towards the little spindle-legged writing-table,
where, on top of a heap of notes, lay the blue oblong of
a cheque-book.</p>

<p>'We consider it part of every day's business to answer questions,'
said Miss Claxton.</p>

<p>'I suppose I can make some little contribution without&mdash;without
its committing me to anything?'</p>

<p>'Committing you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes; it wouldn't get into the papers,' she said, a little shamefaced,
'or&mdash;or anything like that.'</p>

<p>'It wouldn't get into the papers unless you put it in.'</p>

<p>The lady blinked. There was a little pause. She was not
easy to talk to&mdash;this young woman. Nor was she the ideal
collector of contributions.</p>

<p>'That was a remarkable meeting you had in Hyde Park last
Sunday.'</p>

<p>'Remarkable? Oh, no, they're all pretty much alike.'</p>

<p>'Do they all end like that?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes; people come to scoff, and by degrees we get hold of
them&mdash;even the Hyde Park loafers.'</p>

<p>'I mean, do they often crowd up and try to hustle the speakers?'</p>

<p>'Oh, they are usually quite good-natured.'</p>

<p>'You handled them wonderfully.'</p>

<p>'We're used to dealing with crowds.'</p>

<p>Her look went round the room, as if to say, 'It's this kind of
thing I'm not used to, and I don't take to it over-kindly.'</p>

<p>'In the crush at the end,' said Miss Levering, 'I overheard
a scrap of conversation between two men. They were talking
about you. "Very good for a woman," one said.'</p>

<p>Miss Claxton smiled a scornful little smile.</p>

<p>'And the other one said, "It would have been very good for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>a man. And personally," he said, "I don't know many men
who could have kept that crowd in hand for two hours." That's
what two men thought of it.'</p>

<p>She made no answer.</p>

<p>'It doesn't seem to me possible that your speakers average as
good as those I heard on Sunday.'</p>

<p>'We have a good many who speak well, but we look upon
Ernestine Blunt as our genius.'</p>

<p>'Yes, she seems rather a wonderful little person, but I wrote
to you because&mdash;partly because you are older. And you gave
me the impression of being extremely level-headed.'</p>

<p>'Ernestine Blunt is level-headed too,' said Miss Claxton,
warily.</p>

<p>She was looking into the lady's face, frowning a little in that
way of hers, intent, even somewhat suspicious.</p>

<p>'Oh, I dare say, but she's such a child!'</p>

<p>'We sometimes think Ernestine Blunt has the oldest head
among us.'</p>

<p>'Really,' said Miss Levering. 'When a person is as young
as that, you don't know how much is her own and how much
borrowed.'</p>

<p>'She doesn't need to borrow.'</p>

<p>'But <i>you</i>. I said to myself, "That woman, who makes other
things so clear, she can clear up one or two things for me."'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know.' More wary than ever, she suspended
judgment.</p>

<p>'I noticed none of you paid any attention when the crowd called
out&mdash;things about&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Miss Claxton's frown deepened. It was plain she heard the
echo of that insistent, never-answered query of the crowd, 'Got
your dog-whip, miss?' She waited.</p>

<p>It looked as though Miss Levering lacked courage to repeat
it in all its violent bareness.</p>

<p>'&mdash;&mdash;when they called out things&mdash;about the encounters
with the police. It's those stories, as I suppose you know, that
have set so many against the movement.'</p>

<p>No word out of Miss Claxton. She sat there, not leaning
back, nor any longer stiffly upright, but hunched together like
a creature ready to spring.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>'I believed those stories too; but when I had watched you,
and listened to you on Sunday,' Miss Levering hastened to add,
a little shamefaced at the necessity, 'I said to myself, not' (suddenly
she stopped and smiled with disarming frankness)&mdash;'I
didn't say, "That woman's too well-behaved, or too amiable;"
I said, "She's too intelligent. That woman never spat at a policeman.'"</p>

<p>'Spit? No,' she said grimly.</p>

<p>'"Nor bit, nor scratched, nor any of those things. And since
the papers have lied about that," I said to myself, "I'll go to
headquarters for information."'</p>

<p>'What papers do you read?'</p>

<p>'Oh, practically all. This house is like a club for papers and
magazines. My brother-in-law has everything.'</p>

<p>'The <i>Clarion</i>?'</p>

<p>'No, I never saw the <i>Clarion</i>.'</p>

<p>'The <i>Labour Leader</i>?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'The <i>Labour Record</i>?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'It is the organ of our party.'</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I'm afraid I never heard of any of them.'</p>

<p>Miss Claxton smiled.</p>

<p>'I'll take them in myself in future,' said the lady on the sofa.
'Was it reading those papers that set you to thinking?'</p>

<p>'Reading papers? Oh, no. It was&mdash;&mdash;' She hesitated,
and puckered up her brows again as she stared round the room.</p>

<p>'Yes, go on. That's one of the things I wanted to know, if
you don't mind&mdash;how you came to be identified with the movement.'</p>

<p>A little wearily, without the smallest spark of enthusiasm at
the prospect of imparting her biography, Miss Claxton told slowly,
even dully, and wholly without passion, the story of a hard life
met single-handed from even the tender childhood days&mdash;one
of those recitals that change the relation between the one who
tells and the one who listens&mdash;makes the last a sharer in the
life to the extent that the two can never be strangers any more.
Though they may not meet, nor write, nor have any tangible
communication, there is understanding between them.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>At the close Miss Levering stood up and gave the other her
hand. Neither said anything. They looked at each other.</p>

<p>After the lady had resumed her seat, Miss Claxton, as under
some compulsion born of the other's act of sympathy, went on&mdash;</p>

<p>'It is a newspaper lie&mdash;as you haven't needed to be told&mdash;about
the spitting and scratching and biting&mdash;but the day I was
arrested; the day of the deputation to Effingham, I saw a policeman
knocking some of our poorer women about very roughly' (it
had its significance, the tone in which she said 'our poorer women').
'I called out that he was not to do that again. He had one of
our women like this, and he was banging her against the railings.
I called out if he didn't stop I would make him. He kept on'&mdash;a
cold glitter came into the eyes&mdash;'and I struck him. I struck
the coward in the face.'</p>

<p>The air of the mild luxurious room grew hot and quivered.
The lady on the sofa lowered her eyes.</p>

<p>'They must be taught,' the other said sternly, 'the police must
be taught, they are not to treat our women like that. On the
whole the police behave well. But their power is immense and
almost entirely unchecked. It's a marvel they are as decent as
they are. How should <i>they</i> be expected to know how to treat
women? What example do they have? Don't they hear constantly
in the courts how little it costs a man to be convicted of
beating his own wife?' She fired the questions at the innocent
person on the sofa, as if she held her directly responsible for the
need to ask them. 'Stealing is far more dangerous; yes, even
if a man's starving. That's because bread is often dear and
women are always cheap.'</p>

<p>She waited a moment, waited for the other to contradict or
at least resent the dictum. The motionless figure among the
sofa cushions, whose very look and air seemed to proclaim 'some
of us are expensive enough,' hardly opened her lips to say, as if
to herself&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes, women are cheap.'</p>

<p>Perhaps Miss Claxton thought the agreement lacked conviction,
for she went on with a harsh hostility that seemed almost
personal&mdash;</p>

<p>'We'd rather any day be handled by the police than by the
self-constituted stewards of political meetings.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Partly the words, even more the look in the darkening face,
made Miss Levering say&mdash;</p>

<p>'That brings me to something else I wanted to be enlightened
about. One reason I wrote to ask for a little talk with <i>you</i> specially,
was because I couldn't imagine your doing anything so
futile as to pit your physical strength&mdash;considerable as it may
be&mdash;but to pit your muscle against men's is merely absurd.
And I, when I saw how intelligent you were, I saw that you know
all that quite as well as I. Why, then, carry a whip?'</p>

<p>The lowered eyelids of the face opposite quivered faintly.</p>

<p>'You couldn't think it would save you from arrest.'</p>

<p>'No, not from arrest.' The woman's mouth hardened.</p>

<p>'I know'&mdash;Miss Levering bridged the embarrassment of
the pause&mdash;'I know there must be some rational explanation.'</p>

<p>But if there were it was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>'So you see your most indefensible and even futile-appearing
action gave the cue for my greatest interest,' said Vida, with a
mixture of anxiety and bluntness. 'For just the woman you
were, to do so brainless a thing&mdash;what was behind? That
was what I kept asking myself.'</p>

<p>'It&mdash;isn't&mdash;only&mdash;<i>rough</i> treatment one or two of us have
met'&mdash;she pulled out the words slowly&mdash;'it's sometimes worse.'
They both waited in a curious chill embarrassment. 'Not the
police, but the stewards at political meetings, and the men who volunteer
to "keep the women in order," they'&mdash;she raised her fierce
eyes and the colour rose in her cheeks&mdash;'as they're turning us
out they punish us in ways the public don't know.' She saw
the shrinking wonder in the woman opposite, and she did not
spare her. 'They punish us by underhand maltreatment&mdash;of
the kind most intolerable to a decent woman.'</p>

<p>'Oh, no, no!' The other face was a flame to match.</p>

<p>'Yes!' She flung it out like a poisoned arrow.</p>

<p>'How <i>dare</i> they!' said Vida in a whisper.</p>

<p>'They know we dare not complain.'</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>A duller red overspread the face as the woman muttered, 'Nobody,
no woman, wants to talk about it. And if we did they'd
only say, "See! you're killing chivalry." <i>Chivalry!</i>' She
laughed. It was not good to hear a laugh like that.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>The figure on the sofa winced. 'I assure you people don't
know,' said Vida.</p>

<p>'It's known well enough to those who've had to suffer it, and
it's known to the brutes of men who&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah, but you <i>must</i> realize'&mdash;Miss Levering jumped to her
feet&mdash;'you must admit that the great mass of men would be
indignant if they knew.'</p>

<p>'You think so?' The question was insulting in its air of forbearance
with a fairy-tale view of life.</p>

<p>'Think so? I <i>know</i> it. I should be sorry for my own powers
of judgment if I believed the majority of men were like the worst
specimens&mdash;like those you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, well, we don't dwell on that side. It's enough to remember
that women without our incentive have to bear worse. It's
part of a whole system.'</p>

<p>'I shall never believe that!' exclaimed Vida, thinking what
was meant was an organized conspiracy against the Suffragettes.</p>

<p>'Yes, it's all part of the system we are in the world to overturn.
Why should we suppose we'd gain anything by complaining?
Don't hundreds, thousands of meek creatures who have never
defied anybody, don't they have to bear worse ignominies? Every
man knows that's true. Who troubles himself? What is the
use, we say, of crying about individual pains and penalties? No.
The thing is to work day and night to root out the system that
makes such things possible.'</p>

<p>'I still don't understand&mdash;why you thought it would be a
protection to carry&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'A man's fear of ridicule will restrain him when nothing else
will. If one of them is publicly whipped, <i>and by a woman</i>, it
isn't likely to be forgotten. Even the fear of it&mdash;protects us
from some things. After an experience some of the women had,
the moment our committee decided on another demonstration,
little Mary O'Brian went out, without consulting anybody, and
bought me the whip. "If you will go," she said, "you shan't
go unarmed. If we have that sort of cur to deal with, the only
thing is to carry a dog-whip."'</p>

<p>Miss Claxton clenched her hands in their grey cotton gloves.
There was silence in the room for several seconds.</p>

<p>'What we do in asking questions publicly&mdash;it's only what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>men do constantly. The greatest statesman in the land stops
to answer a man, even if he's a fool naturally, or half drunk.
They treat those interrupters with respect, they answer their
questions civilly. They are men. They have votes. But women:
"Where's the chucker out?"'</p>

<p>'Are you never afraid that all you're going through may be
in vain?'</p>

<p>'No. We are quite certain to succeed. We have found the
right way at last.'</p>

<p>'You mean what are called your tactics?'</p>

<p>'I mean the spirit of the women. I mean: not to mind the
price. When you've got people to feel like that, success is sure.'</p>

<p>'But it comes very hard on those few who pay with the person,
as the French say, pay with prison&mdash;and with&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Prison isn't the worst!'</p>

<p>A kind of shyness came over the woman on the sofa; she dropped
her eyes from the other's face.</p>

<p>'Of course,' the ex-prisoner went on, 'if more women did a
little it wouldn't be necessary for the few to do so much.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you are in need of funds to carry on the propaganda.'</p>

<p>'Money isn't what is most needed. One of our workers&mdash;a
little mill girl&mdash;came up from the country with only two pounds
in her pocket to rouse London. And she did it!' her comrade
exulted. 'But there's a class we don't reach. If only'&mdash;she
hesitated and glanced reflectively at the woman before her.</p>

<p>'Yes?' Miss Levering's eye flew to the cheque-book.</p>

<p>'If only we could get women of influence to understand what's
at stake,' said Miss Claxton, a little wistfully.</p>

<p>'They don't?'</p>

<p>'Oh, some. A few. As much as can be expected.'</p>

<p>'Why do you say that?'</p>

<p>'Well, the upper-class women, I don't say all' (she spoke as
one exercising an extreme moderation); 'but many of them are
such sexless creatures.'</p>

<p>Miss Levering opened wide eyes&mdash;a glint of something like
amazed laughter crossed her face, as she repeated&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>They</i> are sexless, you think?'</p>

<p>'We find them so,' said the other, firmly.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>'Why'&mdash;Miss Levering smiled outright&mdash;'that's what they
say of you.'</p>

<p>'Well, it's nonsense, like the rest of what they say.'</p>

<p>The accusation of sexlessness brought against the curled darlings
of society by these hard-working, hard-hitting sisters of
theirs was not the least ironic thing in the situation.</p>

<p>'Why do you call them&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Because we see they have no sex-pride. If they had, they
couldn't do the things they do.'</p>

<p>'What sort of things?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I can't go into that.' She stood up and tugged at her
wrinkled cotton gloves. 'But it's easy for us to see they're sexless.'
She seemed to resent the unbelief in the opposite face.
'Lady Caterham sent for me the other day. You may have
heard of Lady Caterham.'</p>

<p>Miss Levering suppressed the fact of how much, by a vague-sounding&mdash;</p>

<p>'Y&mdash;yes.'</p>

<p>'Well, she sent for me to&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I suppose she was curious!'</p>

<p>'Like me,' said the other, smiling.</p>

<p>'<i>She's</i> a very great person in her county, and she <i>said</i> she sympathized
with the movement&mdash;only she didn't approve of our
tactics, she said. We are pretty well used by now to people who
don't approve of our tactics, so I just sat and waited for the "dog-whip."'</p>

<p>It was obvious that the lady without influence in her county
winced at that, almost as though she felt the whip on her own
shoulders. She was indeed a hard-hitter, this woman.</p>

<p>'I don't go about talking of why I carry a whip. I <i>hate</i> talking
about it,' she flung the words out resentfully. 'But I'd been
sent to try to get that woman to help, and so I explained. I told
her when she asked why it seemed necessary'&mdash;again the face
flushed&mdash;'I told her!&mdash;more than I've told you. And will
you believe it, she never turned a hair. Just sat there with a
look of cool curiosity on her face. Oh, they have no sex-pride,
those upper-class women!'</p>

<p>'Lady Caterham probably didn't understand.'</p>

<p>'Perfectly. She asked questions. No, it just didn't matter
much to her that a woman should suffer that sort of thing. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>didn't feel the indignity of it. Perhaps if it had come to her,
<i>she</i> wouldn't have suffered,' said the critic, with a grim contempt.</p>

<p>'There may be another explanation,' said Miss Levering, a
little curtly, but wisely she forbore to present it.</p>

<p>If the rough and ready reformer had chilled her new sympathizer
by this bitterness against 'the parasite class,' she wiped
out the memory of it by the enthusiasm with which she spoke of
those other women, her fellow-workers.</p>

<p>'Our women are wonderful!' she lifted her tired head. 'I
knew they'd never had a chance to show what they were, but
there are some things&mdash;&mdash; No! I didn't think women had it
in them.'</p>

<p>She had got up and was standing now by the door, her limp
gown clinging round her, her weather-beaten Tam on one side.
But in the confident look with which she spoke of 'our women,'
the brow had cleared. You saw that it was beautiful. Miss
Levering stood at the door with an anxious eye on the stair, as
if fearful of the home-coming of 'her fellow-coward,' or, direr
catastrophe&mdash;old Mr. Fox-Moore's discovering the damning
fact of this outlaw's presence under his roof! Yet, even so, torn
thus between dread and desire to pluck out the heart of the new
mystery, 'the militant woman,' Miss Levering did not speed the
parting guest. As though recognizing fully now that the prophesied
use was not going to be made of the 'thin end of the wedge,'
she detained her with&mdash;</p>

<p>'I wonder when I shall see you again.'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' said the other, absently.</p>

<p>'When is the next meeting?'</p>

<p>'Next Sunday. Every Sunday.'</p>

<p>'I shall be glad to hear you speak again; but&mdash;you'll come
and see me&mdash;here.'</p>

<p>'I can't. I'm going away.'</p>

<p>'Oh! To rest, I hope.'</p>

<p>'Rest?' She laughed at an idea so comic. 'Oh, no. I'm
going to work among the women in Wales. We have great hopes
of those West-country women. They're splendid! They're
learning the secret of co-operation, too. Oh, it's good stuff to
work on&mdash;the relief of it after London!'</p>

<p>Miss Levering smiled. 'Then I won't be seeing you very soon.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>'No.' She seemed to be thinking. 'It's true what I say of
the Welsh women, and yet we oughtn't to be ungrateful to our
London women either.' She seemed to have some sense of injustice
on her soul. 'We've been seeing just recently what they're
made of, too!' She paused on the threshold and began to tell in
a low voice of women 'new to the work,' who had been wavering,
uncertain if they could risk imprisonment&mdash;poor women with
husbands and children. 'When they heard <i>what it might mean</i>&mdash;this
battle we're fighting&mdash;they were ashamed not to help us!'</p>

<p>'You mean&mdash;&mdash;' Vida began, shrinking.</p>

<p>'Yes!' said the other, fiercely. 'The older women saw they
ought to save the younger ones from having to face that sort of
thing. That was how we got some of the wives and mothers.'</p>

<p>She went on with a stern emotion that was oddly contagious,
telling about a certain scene at the Headquarters of the Union.
Against the grey and squalid background of a Poor Women's
movement, stood out in those next seconds a picture that the true
historian who is to come will not neglect. A call for recruits
with this result&mdash;a huddled group, all new, unproved, ignorant
of the ignorant. The two or three leaders, conscience-driven,
feeling it necessary to explain to the untried women that if they
shared in the agitation, they were not only facing imprisonment,
but unholy handling.</p>

<p>'It was only fair to let them know the worst,' said the woman
at the door, 'before they were allowed to join us.'</p>

<p>As the abrupt sentences fell, the grim little scene was reconstituted;
the shrinking of the women who had offered their services
ignorant of this aspect of the battle&mdash;their horror and their
shame. At the memory of that hour the strongly-controlled
voice shook.</p>

<p>'They cried, those women,' she said.</p>

<p>'But they came?' asked the other, trembling, as though for her,
too, it was vital that these poor women should not quail.</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered their leader a little hoarsely, 'they came!'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>One of the oddest things about these neo-Suffragists was the
simplicity with which they accepted aid&mdash;the absence in the
responsible ones of conventional gratitude. This became matter
for both surprise and instruction to the outsider. It no doubt
had the effect of chilling and alienating the 'philanthropist on the
make.' Even to the less ungenerous, not bargainers for approbation
or for influence, even in their case the deep-rooted suspicion
we have been taught to cultivate for one another, makes the gift
of good faith so difficult that it can be given freely only to people
like these, people who plainly and daily suffered for their creed,
who stood to lose all the things most of us strive for, people who
valued neither comfort, nor money, nor the world's good word.
That they took help, and even sacrifice, as a matter of course,
seemed in them mere modesty and sound good sense; tantamount
to saying, 'I am not so silly or self-centred as to suppose you do this
for <i>me</i>. You do it, of course, for the Cause. The Cause is yours&mdash;is
all Women's. You serve humanity. Who am I that I should
thank you?'</p>

<p>This attitude extended even to acts that were in truth prompted
less by concern for the larger issue than by sheer personal interest.</p>

<p>Vida Levering's first experience of this 'new attitude' came one
late afternoon while on her way to leave cards on some people in
Grosvenor Road. Driving through Pimlico about half-past six,
she lifted up her eyes at the sound of many voices and beheld a
mob of men and boys in the act of pursuing a little group of women,
who were fleeing up a side street away from the river. The natural
shrinking and disgust of 'the sheltered woman' showed in the face
of the occupant of the brougham as she leaned forward and said
to the coachman&mdash;</p>

<p>'Not this way! Don't you see there's some disturbance?
Turn back.'</p>

<p>The man obeyed. The little crowd had halted. It looked as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>if the thief, or drunken woman, or what not, had been surrounded
and overwhelmed. The end of the street abutted on Pimlico Pier.
Two or three knots of people were still standing about, talking and
looking up the street at the little crowd of shouting, gesticulating
rowdies. A woman with a perambulator, making up her mind at
just the wrong moment to cross the road, found herself almost
under the feet of the Fox-Moore horses. The coachman pulled
up sharply, and before he had driven on, the lady's eyes had fallen
on an inscription in white chalk on the flagstone&mdash;<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center">
<big>'VOTES FOR WOMEN.</big><br />
<br />
'Meeting here to-night at a quarter to six.'<br /><br />
</p>

<p>The occupant of the carriage turned her head sharply in the direction
of the 'disturbance,' and then&mdash;</p>

<p>'After all, I must go up that street. Drive fast till you get near
those people. Quick!'</p>

<p>'Up <i>there</i>, miss?'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes. Make haste!' For the crowd was moving on, and
still no sign of a policeman.</p>

<p>By the time the brougham caught up with them, the little
huddle of folk had nearly reached the top of the street. In the
middle of the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> a familiar face. Ernestine Blunt!</p>

<p>'Oh, Henderson!'&mdash;Miss Levering put her head out of the
window&mdash;'that girl! the young one! She's being mobbed.'</p>

<p>'Yes, miss.'</p>

<p>'But something must be done! Hail a policeman.'</p>

<p>'Yes, miss.'</p>

<p>'Do you <i>see</i> a policeman?'</p>

<p>'No, miss.'</p>

<p>'Well, stop a moment,' for even at this slowest gait the brougham
had passed the storm centre.</p>

<p>The lady hanging out of the window looked back and saw that
Ernestine's face, very pink as to cheeks, very bright as to eyes, was
turned quite unruffled on the rabble.</p>

<p>'Can't you see the meeting's over?' she called out. 'You boys
go home now and think about what we've told you.'</p>

<p>The reply to that was a laugh and a concerted 'rush' that all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>but carried the girl and her companions off their feet. To Henderson's
petrifaction, the door of the brougham was hastily opened
and then slammed to, leaving Miss Levering in the road, saying
to him over her shoulder&mdash;</p>

<p>'Wait just round the corner, unless I call.'</p>

<p>With which she hurried across the street, her eyes on the little
face that, in spite of its fresh colouring, looked so pathetically tired.
Making her way round the outer fringe of the crowd, Vida saw on
the other side&mdash;near where Ernestine and her sore-beset companions
stood with their backs to the wall&mdash;an opening in the
dingy ranks. Fleet of foot, she gained it, thrust an arm between
the huddled women, and, taking the foolhardy girl by the sleeve,
said, <i>sotto voce</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>'Come! Come with me!'</p>

<p>Ernestine raised her eyes, fixed them for one calm instant on
Vida Levering's face, and then, turning round, said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Where's Mrs. Brown?'</p>

<p>'Never mind Mrs. Brown!' whispered the strange lady, drawing
off as the rowdy young men came surging round that side.</p>

<p>There was another rush and a yell, and Vida fled. When next
she turned to look, it was to see two women making a sudden
dash for liberty. They had escaped through the rowdy ranks,
and they tore across the street, running for their lives and calling
for help as they ran.</p>

<p>Vida, a shade or two paler, stood transfixed. What was going
to happen? But there was the imperturbable Ernestine holding
the forsaken position, still the centre of the pushing, shouting little
mob who had jeered frantically as the other women fled.</p>

<p>It was too much. Not Ernestine's isolation alone, the something
childish in the brilliant face would have enlisted a less sympathetic
observer. A single moment's wavering and the lady made for
the place where the besiegers massed less thick. She was near
enough now to call out over the rowdies' heads&mdash;</p>

<p>'Come. Why do you stay there?'</p>

<p>Faces turned to look at her; while Ernestine shouted back the
cryptic sentence&mdash;</p>

<p>'It wasn't my bus!'</p>

<p><i>Bus?</i> Had danger robbed her of her reason? The boys were
cheering now and looking past Miss Levering: she turned, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>wildered,
to see 'Mrs. Brown' and a sister reformer mounting the
top of a sober London Road car. They had been running for that,
then&mdash;and not for life! Miss Levering raised her hand and her
voice as she looked back at Ernestine&mdash;</p>

<p>'I've got a trap. Come!'</p>

<p>'Where?'</p>

<p>Ernestine stepped out from the vociferating, jostling crowd and
followed the new face as simply as though she had been waiting
for just that summons. The awful moment was when, with a
shout, the tail of rowdies followed after. Miss Levering had not
bargained for that. Her agitated glance left the unsavoury horde
at her heels and went nervously up and down the street. It was
plainly not only, nor even chiefly, the hooligans she feared, but the
amaz&eacute;d eye of some acquaintance. Bad enough to meet Henderson's!</p>

<p>'Jump in!' she said hastily to the girl, and then, 'Go on!' she
called out desperately, flying in after Ernestine and slamming the
door. 'Drive <i>fast</i>!' She thrust her head through the window
to add, '<i>Anywhere!</i>' And she sank back. 'How dreadful that
was!'</p>

<p>'What was?' said the rescued one, glancing out of the carriage
with an air of suddenly renewed interest.</p>

<p>'Why, the attack of those hooligans on a handful of defenceless
women.'</p>

<p>'Oh, they weren't attacking us.'</p>

<p>'What were they doing?'</p>

<p>'Oh, just running after us and screaming a little.'</p>

<p>'But I <i>saw</i> them&mdash;pushing and jostling and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, it was all quite good-natured.'</p>

<p>'You mean you weren't frightened?'</p>

<p>'There's nothing to be frightened at.' She was actually saying
it in a soothing, 'motherly' sort of way, calculated to steady the
lady's nerves&mdash;reassuring the rescuer.</p>

<p>Vida's eye fell on the festoon of braid falling from the dark cloth
skirt.</p>

<p>'Well, the polite attentions of your friends seem to have rather
damaged your gown.'</p>

<p>Over a big leather portfolio that she held clasped in her arms,
Ernestine, too, looked down at the torn frock.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>'That foolish trimming&mdash;it's always getting stepped on.'</p>

<p>Miss Levering's search had produced a pin.</p>

<p>'No; I'll just pull it off.'</p>

<p>Ernestine did so, and proceeded to drop a yard of it out of the
window. Miss Levering began to laugh.</p>

<p>'Which way are we going?' says Miss Blunt, looking out.
'I have to be at Battersea at&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What were you doing at Pimlico Pier?'</p>

<p>'Holding a meeting for the Government employees&mdash;the
people who work for the Army and Navy Clothing Department.'</p>

<p>'Oh. And you live at Battersea?'</p>

<p>'No; but I have a meeting there to-night. We had a very good
one at the Docks, too.' Her eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>'A Suffrage meeting?'</p>

<p>'Yes; one of the best we've had&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'When was that?'</p>

<p>'During the dinner hour. The men stood with their pails and
ate while they listened. They were quite nice and understanding,
those men.'</p>

<p>'What day was that?'</p>

<p>'This morning.'</p>

<p>'And the Battersea meeting?'</p>

<p>'That's not for another hour; but I have to be there first&mdash;to
arrange.'</p>

<p>'When do you dine?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'll get something either before the meeting or after&mdash;whenever
there's time.'</p>

<p>'Isn't it a pity not to get your food regularly? Won't you last
longer if you do?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I shall last.' She sat contentedly, hugging her big portfolio.</p>

<p>The lady glanced at the carriage clock. 'In the house where I
live, dinner is a sort of sacred rite. If you are two seconds late
you are disgraced, so I'm afraid I can't&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'There's the bus I was waiting for!' Ernestine thrust her head
out. 'Stop, will you!' she commanded the astonished Henderson.
'Good-bye.' She nodded, jumped out, shut the door,
steadied her hat, and was gone.</p>

<p>It was so an acquaintance began that was destined to make a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>difference to more than one life. Those days of the summer that
Miss Claxton spent indoctrinating the women of Wales, and that
Mrs. Chisholm utilized in 'organizing Scotland,' were dedicated
by Ernestine and her friends to stirring up London and the various
dim and populous worlds of the suburbs.</p>

<p>Much oftener than even Mrs. Fox-Moore knew, her sister, instead
of being in the houses where she was supposed to be, and
doing the things she was expected to be doing, might have been seen
in highly unexpected haunts prosecuting her acquaintance with
cockney crowds, never learning Ernestine's fearlessness of them,
and yet in some way fascinated almost as much as she was repelled.
At first she would sit in a hansom at safe distance from the turmoil
that was usually created by the expounders of what to the
populace was a 'rum new doctrine' invented by Ernestine. Miss
Levering would lean over the apron of the cab hearing only scraps,
till the final, 'Now, all who are in favour of Justice, hold up their
hands.' As the crowd broke and dissolved, the lady in the hansom
would throw open the doors, and standing up in front of the
dashboard, she would hail and carry off the arch-agitator, while the
crowd surged round. Several times this programme had been
carried out, when one afternoon, after seeing the girl and her big
leather portfolio safe in the cab, and the cab safe out of the crowd,
Vida heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>'<i>There!</i> Now tell me, what did you do yesterday?'&mdash;meaning,
How in the world did you manage without me to take care of you?</p>

<p>'Yesterday? We had a meeting down at the Woolwich Arsenal.
And we distributed handbills for two hours. And we had a debate
in the evening at the New Reform Club.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you didn't hold a meeting here in the afternoon?'</p>

<p>'Yes we did. I forgot that.' She seemed also to have forgotten
that her new friend had been prevented from appearing to carry
her off.</p>

<p>Miss Levering smiled down at her. 'What a funny little person
you are. Do you know who I am?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'It hasn't ever occurred to you to ask?'</p>

<p>The face turned to her with a half roguish smile. 'Oh, I
thought you looked all right.'</p>

<p>'I'm the person who had the interview with your friend, Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Claxton.' As no recollection showed in the face, 'At Queen
Anne's Gate,' she added.</p>

<p>'I don't think I knew about that,' said Ernestine, absently.
Then alert, disdainful, 'Fancy the member for Wrotton saying&mdash;&mdash; Yes,
we went to see him this morning.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that is very exciting! What was he like?'</p>

<p>'Quite a feeble sort of person, I thought.'</p>

<p>'Really!' laughed Miss Levering.</p>

<p>'He talked such nonsense to us about that old Plural Voting
Bill. His idea seemed to be to get us to promise to behave nicely
while the overworked House of Commons considered the iniquity
of some men having more than one vote&mdash;they hadn't a minute
this session to consider the much greater iniquity of no women
having any vote at all! Of course he said he <i>had</i> been a great
friend to Woman Suffrage, until he got shocked with our tactics.'
She smiled broadly. 'We asked him what he'd ever done to show
his friendship.'</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'He didn't seem to know the answer to that. What strikes
me most about men is their being so illogical.'</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Lady John Ulland had been openly surprised, even enthusiastically
grateful, at discovering before this that Vida Levering
was ready to help her with some of the unornamental duties that
fall to the lot of the 'great ladies' of England.</p>

<p>'I don't know what that discontented creature, her sister, means
by saying Vida is so unsympathetic about charity work.'</p>

<p>Neither could Lady John's neighbour, the Bishop, understand
Mrs. Fox-Moore's reproach. Had not his young kinswoman's
charity concerts helped to rebuild the chantry?</p>

<p>'Such a <i>nice creature</i>!' was Lord John's contribution. Then,
showing the profundity of his friendly interest, 'Why doesn't
she find some nice fella to marry her?'</p>

<p>'People don't marry so early nowadays,' his wife reassured him.</p>

<p>Lord Borrodaile, to whom Vida still talked freely, he alone
had some understanding of the changed face life was coming to
wear for her. When he found that laughing at her failed of the
desired effect, he offered touching testimony to his affection for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>her by trying to understand. It was no small thing for a man like
Borrodaile, who, for the rest, found it no easier than others of his
class rightly to interpret the modern scene as looked down upon
from the narrow lancet of the medi&aelig;val tower which was his
mind.</p>

<p>When she got him to smile at her report of the humours of the
populace, he did so against his will, shaking his long Van Dyke
head, and saying&mdash;</p>

<p>'It spoils the fun for me to think of your being there. I have
a quite unconquerable distrust of eccentricity.'</p>

<p>'There's nothing the least original about my mixing with "The
People," as my sister would call them. The women of my world
would often go slumming. The only difference between me and
them may be that I, perhaps, shall go a little farther, that's all.'</p>

<p>'Well, I devoutly hope you won't!' he said, with unusual emphasis.
'Let the proletariat attend to the affairs of the proletariat.
They don't need a woman like you.'</p>

<p>'They not only need&mdash;what's more, they are getting, all kinds!
It's that, more than anything else, that shows their strength. The
miracle it is, to see the way they all work together! Women, the
poorest and most ignorant (except of hardship), working shoulder
to shoulder with women of substance and position. Oh, yes, they
are winning over that sort, teachers and university graduates&mdash;a
whole group who would be called Intellectuals if they were men&mdash;all
doing what men have said women could never do&mdash;pulling
together. And, oh! that reminds me,' she said suddenly, smiling
as one who has thought of a capital joke at her companion's expense:
'it's my duty to warn you. I went with your daughter to
lunch at her Country Club, and they were all discussing the Suffrage!
A good dozen! And Sophia&mdash;well, Sophia came out
in a new light. I want you, please, to believe <i>I've</i> never talked to
her.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said Borrodaile, with an unconscious arrogance, 'Sophia
doesn't wait to be talked to. She takes her own line. Politics
are a tradition with our women. I found her reading the parliamentary
debates when she was fourteen.'</p>

<p>'And your boys, are they equally&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>He sighed. 'The world has got very topsy-turvy. All my girls
are boys&mdash;and all my boys are girls.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well, Sophia can take care of the Country Club! I remember
how we scoffed when she organized it.'</p>

<p>'It's had precisely the effect I expected. Takes her away from
her own home, where she ought to be&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Who wants her at home?'</p>

<p>Unblushingly he answered, '<i>I</i> do.'</p>

<p>'Why, you're never there yourself.' He blinked. 'When you
aren't in your garden you're&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Here?' he laughed.</p>

<p>'I don't myself,' she went on, '<i>I</i> don't belong to any clubs&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I should hope not, indeed! Where should I go for tea and for
news of the workings of the Zeitgeist?' he mocked.</p>

<p>'But I begin to see what women's clubs are for.'</p>

<p>'They're for the dowdy, unattached females to meet and gossip
in, to hold feeble little debates in, to listen to pettifogging little
lectures, and imagine they're <i>dans le mouvement</i>.'</p>

<p>'They are to accustom women to thinking and acting together.
While you and I have been laughing at them, they've been building
up a huge machinery of organization, ready to the hand of the
chief engineer who is to come.'</p>

<p>'Horrible thought!'</p>

<p>'Well, horrible or not, I don't despise clubs any more. They're
largely responsible for the new corporate spirit among women.'</p>

<p>He pulled himself out of the cavernous comfort of his chair,
and stood glooming in front of the screen that hid the fireless grate.</p>

<p>'Clubs, societies, leagues, they're all devices for robbing people
of their freedom. It's no use to talk to me. I'm one of the few
individualists left in the world. I never wanted in my life to belong
to any body.' Her pealing laughter made him explain, smiling,
'To any corporation, was what I meant.'</p>

<p>'No, no. You got it right the first time! The reason that, in
spite of my late perversities, you don't cast me off is because I'm
one of the few women who don't make claims.'</p>

<p>'It is the claim of the community that I resent. I want to keep
clear of all complication. I want to be really free. I could never
have pledged myself to any Church or any party.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps'&mdash;she smiled at him&mdash;'perhaps that's why you are
a beautiful and ineffectual angel.'</p>

<p>'The reason I never did is because I care about liberty&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>thing itself. You are in danger, I see, of being enamoured of the
name. In thought women are always half a century or so behind.
What patriot's voice is heard in Europe or America to-day?
Where is the modern Kossuth, Garibaldi? What poet goes out
in these times to die at Missolonghi? Just as men are finding
out the vanity of the old dreams, the women seem to be seizing
on them. The mass of intelligent men have no longing for political
power. If a sort of public prominence is thrust on men'&mdash;he
shrugged as if his shoulders chafed under some burden&mdash;'<i>in
their hearts</i> they curse their lot. I suppose it's all so new to the
woman she is amused. She even&mdash;I'm <i>told</i>'&mdash;his lifted hand,
with the closed fingers suddenly flung open, advertised the difficulty
a sane person found in crediting the uncanny rumour&mdash;'I'm
<i>told</i> that women even like public dinners.'</p>

<p>'Well, you do.'</p>

<p>'I?'</p>

<p>'You go&mdash;to all the most interesting ones.'</p>

<p>'Part of my burden! Unlike your new friends, there's nothing
I hate so much, unless it is having to make a speech.'</p>

<p>'Well, now, shall I stop "playing at ma'ams" and just say
that when I hear a man like you explaining in that superior way
how immensely he <i>doesn't care</i>, I seem to see that that is precisely
the worst indictment against your class. If special privilege breeds
that&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>It merely amused him to see that she was forgetting herself. He
sat down again. He stretched out his long legs and interlaced his
fingers across his bulging shirt front. His air of delicate mockery
supplied the whip.</p>

<p>'If,' Vida went on with shining eyes, 'if to be able to care and
to work and to sacrifice, if to get those impulses out of life, you must
carry your share of the world's burden, then no intelligent creature
can be sorry the day is coming when all men will have to&mdash;&mdash;'
She took breath, a little frightened to see where she was going.</p>

<p>'Have to&mdash;&mdash;?' he encouraged her, lazily smiling.</p>

<p>'Have to work, or else not eat.'</p>

<p>'Even under your hard rule I wouldn't have to work much.
My appetite is mercifully small.'</p>

<p>'It would grow if you sweated for your bread.'</p>

<p>'Help! help!' he said, not above his usual tone, but slowly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>he turned his fine head as the door opened. He fixed the amused
grey-green eyes on old Mr. Fox-Moore: 'A small and inoffensive
pillar of the Upper House is in the act of being abolished.'</p>

<p>'What, is she talking politics? She never favours me with her
views,' said Fox-Moore, with his chimpanzee smile.</p>

<p>When Borrodaile had said good-bye, Vida followed him to the top
of the stairs.</p>

<p>'It's rather on my mind that I&mdash;I've not been very nice to you.'</p>

<p>'"I would not hear thine enemy say so."'</p>

<p>'Yes, I've been rather horrid. I went and Trafalgar-Squared
you, when I ought to have amused you.'</p>

<p>'But you have amused me!' His eyes shone mischievously.</p>

<p>'Oh, very well.' She took the gibe in good part, offering her
hand again.</p>

<p>'Good-bye, my dear,' he said gently. 'It's great fun having you
in the world!' He spoke as though he had personally arranged this
provision against dulness for his latter end.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The next evening he came up to her at a party to ask why she
had absented herself from a dinner the night before where he expected
to find her.</p>

<p>'Oh, I telephoned in the morning they weren't to expect me.'</p>

<p>'What were you doing, I should like to know?'</p>

<p>'No, you wouldn't like to know. But you couldn't have helped
laughing if you'd seen me.'</p>

<p>'Where?'</p>

<p>'Wandering about the purlieus of Battersea.'</p>

<p>'Bless me! Who with?'</p>

<p>'Why, with that notorious Suffragette, Miss Ernestine Blunt.
Oh, you'd have stared even harder if you'd seen us, I promise
you! She with a leather portfolio under one arm&mdash;a most
business-like apparatus, and a dinner-bell in one hand.'</p>

<p>'A <i>dinner</i> bell!' He put his hand to his brow as one who feels
reason reeling.</p>

<p>'Yes, holding fast to the clapper so that we shouldn't affright
the isle out of season. I, if you please, carrying an armful of
propagandist literature.'</p>

<p>'Good Lord! <i>Where</i> do you say these orgies take place?'</p>

<p>'Near the Fire Station on the far side of Battersea Park.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>'I think you are in great need of somebody to look after you,'
he laughed, but no one who knew him could mistake his seriousness.
'Come over here.' He found a sofa a little apart from the
crush. 'Who goes with you on these raids?'</p>

<p>'Why, Ernestine&mdash;or rather, I go with her.'</p>

<p>'But who takes care of you?'</p>

<p>'Ernestine.'</p>

<p>'Who knows you're doing this kind of thing?'</p>

<p>'Ernestine&mdash;and you. It's a secret.'</p>

<p>'Well, if I'm the only sane person who knows&mdash;it's something
of a responsibility.'</p>

<p>'I won't tell you about it if it oppresses you.'</p>

<p>'On the contrary, I insist on your telling me.'</p>

<p>Vida smiled reflectively. 'The mode of procedure strikes one
as highly original. It is simple beyond anything in the world.
They select an open space at the convergence of several thoroughfares&mdash;if
possible, near an omnibus centre. For these smaller
meetings they don't go to the length of hiring a lorry. Do you
know what a lorry is?'</p>

<p>'I regret to say my education in that direction leaves something
to be desired.'</p>

<p>'Last week I was equally ignorant. To-day I can tell you all
about it. A lorry is a cart or a big van with the top off. But
such elegancies are for the parks. In Battersea, you go into some
modest little restaurant, and you say, "Will you lend me a chair?"
This is a surprise for the Battersea restaurateur.'</p>

<p>'Naturally&mdash;poor man!'</p>

<p>'Exactly. He refuses. But he also asks questions. He
is amazed. He is against the franchise for women. "You'll
<i>never</i> get the vote!" "Well, we must have something," says Ernestine.
"I'm sure it isn't against your principles to lend a woman
a chair." She lays hands on one. "I never said you could have
one of my&mdash;&mdash;" "But you meant to, didn't you? Isn't a chair
one of the things men have always been ready to offer us? Thank
you. I'll take good care of it and bring it back quite safe." Out
marches Ernestine with the enemy's property. She carries the chair
into the road and plants it in front of the Fire Station. Usually
there are two or three "helpers." Sometimes Ernestine, if you
please, carries the meeting entirely on her own shoulders&mdash;those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>same shoulders being about so wide. Yes, she's quite a little
thing. If there are helpers she sends them up and down the street
sowing a fresh crop of handbills. When Ernestine is ready to begin
she stands up on that chair, in the open street and, as if she
were doing the most natural thing in the world, she begins ringing
that dinner bell. Naturally people stop and stare and draw nearer.
Ernestine tells me that Battersea has got so used now to the ding-dong
and to associating it with "our meeting," that as far off as
they hear it the inhabitants say, "It's the Suffragettes! Come
along!" and from one street and another the people emerge laughing
and running. Of course as soon as there is a little crowd that
attracts more, and so the snowball grows. Sometimes the traffic
is impeded. Oh, it's a much odder world than I had suspected!'
For a moment laughter interrupted the narrative. '"The Salvation
Army doesn't <i>quite</i> approve of us," Ernestine says, "and the
Socialists don't love us either! We always take their audiences
away from them&mdash;poor things," says Ernestine, with a sympathetic
air. "<i>You</i> do!" I say, because'&mdash;Vida nodded at Lord Borrodaile&mdash;'you
must know Ernestine is a beguiler.'</p>

<p>'Oh, a beguiler. I didn't suppose&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, it's against the tradition, I know, but it's true. She herself,
however, doesn't seem to realize her beguilingness. "It
isn't any one in particular they come to hear," she says, "it's
just that a woman making a speech is so much more interesting
than a man making a speech." It surprises you? So it did me.'</p>

<p>'Nothing surprises me!' said Borrodaile, with a wave of his long
hands.</p>

<p>'Last night she was wonderful, our Ernestine! Even I, who
am used to her, I was stirred. I was even thrilled. She had that
crowd in the hollow of her hand! When she wound up, "The motion
is carried. The meeting is over!" and climbed down off
her perch, the mob cheered and pressed round her so close that
I had to give up trying to join her. I extricated myself and crossed
the street. She is so little that, unless she's on a chair, she is
swallowed up. For a long time I couldn't see her. I didn't know
whether she was taking the names and addresses of the people
who want to join the Union, or whether she had slipped away
and gone home, till I saw practically the whole crowd moving off
after her up the street. I followed for some distance on the off-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>side.
She went calmly on her way, a tiny figure in a long grey
coat between two helpers, the Lancashire cotton-spinner and the
Cockney working woman, with that immense tail of boys and men
(and a few women) all following after&mdash;quite quiet and well-behaved&mdash;just
following, because it didn't occur to them to do
anything else. In a way she was still exercising her hold over her
meeting. I saw, presently, there was one person in front of her&mdash;a
great big fellow&mdash;he looked like a carter&mdash;he was carrying
home the chair!'</p>

<p>They both laughed.</p>

<p>'Well, she's found a thick-and-thin advocate in you apparently,'
said Borrodaile.</p>

<p>'Ah! if only you could <i>see</i> her! trudging along, apparently
quite oblivious of her quaint following, dinner bell in one hand,
leather case piled high with "tracts" on the other arm, some of the
leaflets sliding off, tumbling on to the pavement.' Vida laughed
as she recalled the scene. 'Then dozens of hands darting out to
help her to recover her precious property! After the chair had
been returned the crowd thinned, and I crossed over to her.'</p>

<p>'You in that <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>!' Borrodaile ejaculated. 'Well, Ernestine
hadn't the quaintness all to herself.'</p>

<p>'No. Oh, no,' Vida agreed. 'I thought of you, and how you'd
look if you had come on us suddenly. After the crowd had melted
and the helpers had vanished into the night, we went on together&mdash;all
the way, from the Battersea Fire Station to Sloane Square,
did Ernestine and I walk, talking reform last night. You laugh?
So do I; but not at Ernestine. She's a most wonderful person.
I sometimes ask myself if the world will ever know half how
wonderful. You, for instance, you haven't, after all I've said, you
haven't <i>an idea</i>!'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't doubt&mdash;I don't think I ever doubted that women
have a facility in speech&mdash;no, no, I'm not gibing! I don't even
doubt they can, as you say, sway and control crowds. But I
maintain it is very bad for the women.'</p>

<p>'How is it bad?'</p>

<p>'How can it fail to be! All that horrible publicity. All that
concentrating of crude popular interest on themselves! Believe
me, nobody who watches a public career carefully but sees the
demoralizing effect the limelight has even on men's characters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
And I suppose you'll admit that men are less delicately organized
than women.'</p>

<p>'I can only say I've seen the sort of thing you mean in our
world, where a good many women have only themselves to think
about. I've looked in vain for those evil effects among the Suffrage
women. It almost seems, on the contrary, as if there were
something ennobling in working for a public cause.'</p>

<p>'Personally, I can't say I've observed it&mdash;not among the political
women of my acquaintance!'</p>

<p>'But you only know the old kind. Yes, the kind whose idea of
influence is to make men fall in love with them, whose idea of
working is to put on a smart gown and smile their prettiest. No,
I agree that <i>isn't</i> necessarily ennobling!'</p>

<p>'I see, it's the new taste in manners and the new arts of persuasion
that make the ideal women and'&mdash;with an ironic little bow&mdash;'the
impassioned convert.'</p>

<p>'I'm bound to admit,' she said stoutly, 'that I think the Suffrage
movement in England has the advantage of being engineered by
a very remarkable set of women. Not in ability alone, but in dignity
of character. People will never know, I sometimes think,
how much the movement has owed to being taken in hand by just
these particular women. I don't pretend they're the average.
They're very far above the average. And what the world will
owe to them I very much doubt if even the future will know.
But I seem to be the only one who minds.' She laughed. 'I could
take my oath <i>they</i> never give the matter a thought. One thing&mdash;&mdash;'
She leaned forward and then checked herself. 'No, I've
talked about them enough!'</p>

<p>She opened her fan and looked about the crowded room.</p>

<p>'Say what you were going to. I'm reconciled. I see what's
coming.'</p>

<p>'What's coming?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Go on.'</p>

<p>She looked at him a little perplexed over the top of her fan.</p>

<p>'I was only going to say that what struck me particularly in
that girl, for instance, is her inaccessibility to flattery. I've watched
her with men.'</p>

<p>'Of course! She knew you were watching her. She no doubt
thinks the eyes of the world are upon her.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>'On the contrary, it's her unselfconsciousness that's the most
surprising thing about her. Or, no! It's something more interesting
even than that. She is conscious, in a way, of the hold she
has on the public. But it hasn't any of the deteriorating effect
you were deprecating. I've been moved once or twice to congratulate
her. She takes it as unmoved as a child. It's just as if you
said to a little thing of three, "What a clever baby you are!" or,
"You've got the most beautiful eyes in the world." The child
would realize that you meant well, that you were being pleasant,
but it wouldn't think about either its cleverness or its eyes. It's
like that with Ernestine. When I said to her, "You made an
astoundingly good speech to-night. The best I've heard even you
make," she looked at me with a sort of half-absent-minded, half-wondering
expression, without a glimmer of personal vanity.
When I was so ill-advised as not to drop the subject, when I
ventured to say something more about that great gift of hers, she
interrupted me with a little laugh, "It's a sign of grace in you not to
get tired of our speeches," she said. "I suppose we repeat ourselves
a good deal. You see that's just what we've got to do.
We've got to <i>hammer it in</i>." But the fact is that she doesn't
repeat herself, that she's always fresh and stimulating, because&mdash;I
suppose it's because she's always thinking of the Great Impersonal
Object, and talking about it out of her own eager heart.
Ernestine? She's as unhackneyed as a spring morning!'</p>

<p>'Oh, very well. I'll go.'</p>

<p>'Go? Where?' for he still sat there.</p>

<p>'Why, to hear your paragon. I've seen that was what you were
leading up to.'</p>

<p>'N&mdash;no. I don't think I want you to go.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, you do. I knew you'd make me sooner or later.'</p>

<p>'No, don't be afraid.' She stood up.</p>

<p>'I'm not afraid. I'm eager,' he laughed.</p>

<p>She shook her head. 'No, I'll never take you.'</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>'Because&mdash;it isn't all Ernestine and skittles. And because
you'd make me keenly alive again to all sorts of things that I see
now don't matter&mdash;things that have lost some of their power to
trouble me, but that I should feel for you.'</p>

<p>'What sort of&mdash;&mdash;'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh, oddities, uglinesses&mdash;things that abound, I'm told, at all
men's meetings, and that yet, somehow, we'd like to eliminate
from women's quite on the old angel theory. No, I won't take
you!'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>The following afternoon, at half-past five, the carelessly dressed,
rather slouching figure of Lord Borrodaile might have been seen walking
along the Thames Embankment in the neighbourhood of Pimlico
Pier. He passed without seeing the only other person visible at
that quiet hour&mdash;one of the 'unemployed,' like himself, but save
in that respect sufficiently unlike the Earl of Borrodaile was the
grimy, unshaven tramp collapsed in one corner of the double-seated
municipal bench. Lord Borrodaile's fellow-citizen leaned
heavily on one of the stout scrolls of ironwork which, repeated at
regular intervals on each side, divided the seat into six compartments.
No call for any one to notice such a man&mdash;there are so
many of them in these piping times of peace and prosperity.
Then, too, they go crawling about our world protected from notice,
as the creatures are who take their colouring from bark or leaf or
arctic snows. So these other forms of life, weather-beaten, smoke-begrimed,
subdued to the hues of the dusty roads they travel, and
the unswept spaces where they sleep&mdash;over these the eye glides
unseeing.</p>

<p>As little interested in the gentleman as the gentleman was in
him, the wastrel contemplated the river with grimly speculative
eye. But when suddenly Borrodaile's sauntering figure came to a
standstill near the lower end of the bench, the tramp turned his
head and watched dully the gloveless hands cross one over the other
on the knob of the planted umbrella; the bent head; one hand
raised now, groping about the waistcoat, lighting upon what it
sought and raising a pince-nez, through which he read the legend
scrawled in chalk upon the pavement. With a faint saturnine
smile Lord Borrodaile dropped the glass, and took his bearings.
He consulted his watch, and walked on.</p>

<p>Upon his return a quarter of an hour later, he viewed the same
little-alluring prospect from the opposite side of the street. The
tramp still stared at the river, but on his side of the bench, at the
other end, sat a lady reading a book. Between the two motionless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>figures and the parapet, a group of dirty children were wrangling.
Lord Borrodaile crossed the wide street and paused a moment just
behind the lady. He leaned forward as if to speak to her across
the middle division of the bench. But he reconsidered, and turning
his back to her, sat down and drew an evening paper out of
his pocket. He was so little like that glittering figment, the peer
of popular imagination, that the careless sobriety of dress and air
in the person of this third occupant of the capacious double bench
struck an even less arresting note than the frank wretchedness of
the other man.</p>

<p>Presently one of the children burst out crying, and continued to
howl lustily till the lady looked up from her page and inquired
what was the matter. The unwashed infant stared open-mouthed
at this intruder upon her grief. Instead of answering, she regarded
the lady with a bored astonishment, as who should say: What are
you interrupting me for, just in the middle of a good yell? She
then took up the strain as nearly as possible where she had left off.
She was getting on very well with this second attempt at a demonstration
until Miss Levering made some mention of a penny, whereupon
the infant again suspended her more violent manifestations,
though the tears kept rolling down.</p>

<p>After various attempts on the lady's part, the little girl was
induced to come and occupy the middle place on the river side of
the bench, between Vida and the tramp. While the lady held the
penny in her hand, and cross-examined the still weeping child,
Borrodaile sat quietly listening behind his paper. When the child
couldn't answer those questions that were of a general nature, the
tramp did, and the three were presently quite a pleasant family
party. The only person 'out of it' was the petrified gentleman on
the other side.</p>

<p>A few minutes before the arrival of the Suffragettes, two nondescript
young men, in a larky mood, appeared with the announcement
that they'd seen 'one of them' at the top of Ranelagh Street.</p>

<p>'That'll be the little 'un,' said the tramp to nobody. 'You
don't ketch 'er bein' late!'</p>

<p>'Blunt! No&mdash;cheeky little devil,' remarked one of the young
men, offering a new light upon the royal virtue of punctuality;
but from the enthusiasm with which they availed themselves of the
rest of Lord Borrodaile's side of the bench, it was obvious they had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>hurried to the spot with the intention of securing front seats at the
show.</p>

<p>'Of course it ain't goin' to be as much fun as the 'Yde Park
Sunday aufternoons. Jim Wrightson goes to them. Keeps things
lively&mdash;'e does.'</p>

<p>'Kicks up a reg'lar shindy, don't 'e?'</p>

<p>'Yes. We can't do nothin' 'ere&mdash;ain't enough'&mdash;whether of
space or of spirited young men he did not specify.</p>

<p>As they lit their cigarettes the company received further
additions&mdash;one obviously otherwise employed than with politics.
Her progress&mdash;was it symbolic?&mdash;was necessarily slow, for a
small child clung to her skirt, and she trundled a sickly boy in a
go-cart. The still sniffling person in possession of the middle seat
on the other side (her anxious and watery eye fixed on the penny)
was told by Miss Levering to make room for the new-comers.
The child's way of doing so was to crowd closer to the neighbourhood
of the fascinating coin. But that mandate to 'make room'
had proved a conversational opening through which poured&mdash;or
trickled rather&mdash;the mother's sorry little history. Her husband
was employed in the clothing department of the Army and Navy
Stores&mdash;yes, nine years now. He was considered very lucky to
keep his place when the staff was reduced. But the costliness of
raising the children! It was well that three were dead. If she
had it all to do over again&mdash;no! no!</p>

<p>The seeming heartlessness with which she envisaged the non-existence
of her babies contrasted strangely with her patient tenderness
to the querulous boy in the go-cart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Miss Levering had not forgotten her earlier acquaintance.
As the wan mother watched the end of the transaction
which left the sniffler now quite consoled, in possession of the
modest coin, she said na&iuml;vely&mdash;</p>

<p>'When anybody gives one of my children a penny, I always save
half of it for them the next day.'</p>

<p>Vida Levering turned her head away, and in so doing met Lord
Borrodaile's eyes over the back of the bench. She gave a faint
start of surprise, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>'She saves half of it!' was all she said.</p>

<p>Borrodaile, glancing shrewdly over the further augmented
gathering, asked the invariable question&mdash;</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>'How do you account for the fact that so few women are here
to show their interest in a matter that's supposed to concern them
so much?' Vida craned her head. 'Beside you, only one!'
Borrodaile's mocking voice went on. 'Isn't this an instance of
your sex's indifference to the whole thing? Isn't it equally an
instance of man's keenness about public questions?' He couldn't
forbear adding in a whisper, 'Even such a question, and such men?'</p>

<p>Vida still craned, searching in vain for refutation in female form.
But she did not take her failure lying down.</p>

<p>'The men who are here,' she said, 'the great majority of men at
all open-air meetings seem to be loafers. Woman&mdash;whatever
else she may or may not be&mdash;isn't a loafer!' Through Borrodaile's
laugh she persisted. 'A woman always seems to have
something to do, even if it's of the silliest description. Yes, and
if she's a decent person at all, she's not hanging about at street
corners waiting for some diversion!'</p>

<p>'Not bad; not bad! I see you are catching the truly martial
spirit.'</p>

<p>'That's them, ain't it?' One of the young men jumped up.</p>

<p>Vida turned her head in time to see the meeting between two
girls and a woman arriving from opposite directions.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she whispered; 'that's Ernestine with the pile of
handbills on her arm.'</p>

<p>The lady sent out smiles and signals of welcome with a lifted
hand. The busy propagandist took no notice. She was talking
to her two companions, one of whom, the younger with head on
one side, kept shooting out glances half provocative, half appealing,
towards Lord Borrodaile and the young men. She seemed as
keenly alive to the fact of these male presences as the two other
women seemed oblivious.</p>

<p>'Which is the one,' asked Lord Borrodaile, 'that you were telling
me about?'</p>

<p>'Why, Ernestine Blunt&mdash;the pink-cheeked one in the long
alpaca coat.'</p>

<p>'She doesn't look so very devilish,' he laughed. After an
impatient moment's hope that devilishness might develop, he said,
'She hasn't seen you yet.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, she has.'</p>

<p>'Then she isn't as overjoyed as she ought to be.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>'She'd be surprised to know she was expected to be overjoyed.'</p>

<p>'Why? Aren't you very good to her?'</p>

<p>'No. She's been rather good to me, though she doesn't take
very much stock in me.'</p>

<p>'Why doesn't she?'</p>

<p>'Oh, there are only two kinds of people that interest Ernestine.
Those who'll be active in carrying on the propaganda, and those
who have yet to be converted.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'm disappointed,' he teased, perceiving how keen his
friend was that he should not be. 'The other one would be more
likely to convert <i>me</i>.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you only say that because the other one's tall, and makes
eyes!' Vida denounced him, to his evident diversion.</p>

<p>Whatever his reasons were, the young men seemed to share his
preference. They were watching the languishing young woman,
who in turn kept glancing at them. Ernestine, having finished
what she was saying, made her way to where Miss Levering sat,
not, it would appear, for any purpose so frivolous as saying good
evening, but to deposit what were left of the handbills and the
precious portfolio in the care of one well known by now to have a
motherly oversight of such properties.</p>

<p>Lord Borrodaile's eyes narrowed with amusement as he watched
the hurried pantomime.</p>

<p>Instead of 'Thank you,' as Vida meekly accepted the incongruous
and by no means light burden: 'We are short of speakers,'
said Ernestine. 'You'll help us out, won't you?' As though it
were the simplest thing in the world.</p>

<p>Lord Borrodaile half rose in protest.</p>

<p>'No,' said Vida. 'I won't speak till I have something to say.'</p>

<p>'I should have thought there was plenty to <i>say</i>!' said the girl.</p>

<p>'Yes, for you. You know such a lot,' smiled her new friend.
'I must get some first-hand knowledge, too, before I try to stand
up and speechify.'</p>

<p>'It's now we need help. By-and-by there'll be plenty. But
I'm not going to worry you,' she caught herself up. Then, confidentially,
'We've got one new helper that we've great hopes of.
She joined to-day.'</p>

<p>'Some one who can speak?'</p>

<p>'Oh, she'll speak, I dare say, by and by.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>'What does she do in the meantime&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;' (to account for
your enthusiasm, was implied) 'to show she's a helper? Subscribes?'</p>

<p>'I expect she'll subscribe, too. She takes such an interest.
Plenty of courage, too.'</p>

<p>'How do you know?'</p>

<p>'Well'&mdash;the voice dropped&mdash;'she's <i>all right</i>, but she belongs
to rather stodgy people. Bothers about respectability, and that
sort of thing. But she came along with me this afternoon distributing
handbills all over the City for two hours! Not many
women of her kind are ready to do <i>that</i> the first thing.'</p>

<p>'No, I dare say not,' said Vida, humbly.</p>

<p>'And one thing I thought a very good sign'&mdash;Ernestine bent
lower in her enthusiasm&mdash;'when we got to Finsbury Circus she
said'&mdash;Ernestine paused as if struck afresh by the merits of the
new recruit&mdash;'she said, "<i>Give me a piece of chalk!</i>"'</p>

<p>'Chalk! What did she want with&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>Borrodaile, too, leaned nearer.</p>

<p>'She saw me beginning to write meeting notices on the stones.
Of course, the people stopped and stared and laughed. But she,
instead of getting shy, and pretending she hadn't anything to do
with me, she took the chalk and wrote, "Votes for Women!" all
over the pavement of Finsbury Circus.' Ernestine paused a
moment that Miss Levering might applaud the new 'helper.'
'I thought that a very good sign in such a respectable person.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes; a most encouraging sign. Is it the one in mauve who
did that?'</p>

<p>'No, that's&mdash;I forget her name&mdash;oh, Mrs. Thomas. She's
new, too. I'll have to let her speak if you won't,' she said, a trifle
anxiously.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Thomas, by all means,' murmured Borrodaile, as Ernestine,
seeing her plea was hopeless, turned away.</p>

<p>Vida caught her by the coat. 'Where are the others? The rest
of your <i>good</i> speakers?'</p>

<p>'Scattered up and down. Getting ready for the General
Election. That's why we have to break in new people. Oh, she
sent me some notes, that girl did. I must give them back to her.'</p>

<p>Ernestine stooped and opened the portfolio on Miss Levering's
lap. She rummaged through the bulging pockets.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>'I thought,' said Miss Levering, with obvious misgiving, 'I
thought I hadn't seen that affected-looking creature before.'</p>

<p>'Oh, she'll get over all that,' Ernestine whispered. 'You
haven't much opinion of our crowds, but they can teach people a lot.'</p>

<p>'Teach them not to hold their heads like a broken lily?'</p>

<p>'Yes, knock all sorts of nonsense out and stiffen them up wonderfully.'</p>

<p>She found the scrap of paper, and shut the portfolio with a snap.</p>

<p>'Now!'</p>

<p>She stood up, took in the fact of the audience having increased
and a policeman in the offing. She summoned her allies.</p>

<p>'It's nearly time for those Army and Navy workers to come out.
The men will come first,' she said, 'and five minutes after, they let
the women out. I'll begin, and then I think you'd better speak
next,' she said, handing the die-away young woman her notes.
'These seem all right.'</p>

<p>'Oh, but, Miss Blunt,' she whispered, 'I'm so nervous. How
am I ever to face all those men?'</p>

<p>'You'll find it quite easy when once you are started,' said Ernestine,
in a quiet undertone.</p>

<p>'But I'm so afraid that, just out of pure nervousness, I'll say the
wrong thing.'</p>

<p>'If you do, I'll be there,' returned the chairman, a little grimly.</p>

<p>'But it's the very first time in my life&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Now, look here&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Ernestine reached out past this person who was luxuriating in
her own emotions, and drew the ample mauve matron into the
official group close to where Miss Levering sat nursing the handbills.</p>

<p>'It's easy enough talking to these little meetings. They're
quite good and quiet&mdash;not a bit like Hyde Park.' (One of the
young men poked the other. They exchanged looks.) 'But there
are three things we all agree it's just as well to keep in mind:
Not to talk about ourselves'&mdash;she measured off the tit-bits of
wisdom with a slim forefinger&mdash;'not to say anything against the
press, and, if possible, remember to praise the police.'</p>

<p>'Praise the police!' ejaculated the mauve matron.</p>

<p>'Sh!' said Ernestine, softly. But not so easily was the tide of
indignation stemmed.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>'I saw with my own eyes&mdash;&mdash;' began the woman.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, but&mdash;&mdash;' she lowered her voice, Borrodaile had to
strain to catch what she said, 'you see it's no use beating our heads
against a stone wall. A movement that means to be popular
must have the police on its side. After all, they do very well&mdash;considering.'</p>

<p>'Considering they're men?' demanded the matron.</p>

<p>'Anyhow,' Ernestine went on, 'even if they behaved ten times
worse, it's not a bit of good to antagonize the police or the press.
If they aren't our friends, we've got to make them our friends.
They're both <i>much</i> better than they were. They must be encouraged!'
said the wise young Daniel, with a little nod. Then
as she saw or felt that the big matron might elude her vigilance
and break out into indiscretion, 'Why, we had a reporter in from
the <i>Morning Magnifier</i> only to-day. He said, "The public seems
to have got tired of reading that you spit and scratch and prod
policemen with your hatpins. Now, do you mind saying what is
it you really do?" I told him to come here this afternoon. Now,
when I've opened the meeting, <i>you'll</i> tell him!'</p>

<p>'Oh, <i>dear</i>!' the young woman patted her fringe, 'do you suppose
we'll be in the <i>Magnifier</i> to-morrow? How dreadful!'</p>

<p>During this little interchange a procession of men streaming
homeward in their hundreds came walking down the Embankment
in twos and threes or singly, shambling past the loosely gathered
assemblage about the bench.</p>

<p>The child on the riverward side still clutching its penny was unceremoniously
ousted. As soon as Ernestine had mounted the
seat the slackly held gathering showed signs of cohesion. The
waiting units drew closer. The dingy procession slowed&mdash;the
workmen, looking up at the young face with the fluttering sycamore
shadows printed on its pink and white, grinned or frowned,
but many halted and listened. Through the early part of the
speech Miss Levering kept looking out of the corner of her eye to
see what effect it had on Borrodaile. But Borrodaile gave no
sign. Ernestine was trying to make it clear what a gain it would
be, especially to this class, if women had the vote. An uphill task
to catch and hold the attention of those tired workmen. They
hadn't stopped there to be made to think&mdash;if they weren't going
to be amused, they'd go home. A certain number did go home,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>after pausing to ask the young Reformer, more or less good-humouredly,
why she didn't get married. Lord Borrodaile had
privately asked for enlightenment on the same score. Vida had
only smiled. One man varied the monotony by demanding why,
if it would be a good thing for the working class to have women
voting, why didn't the Labour Party take up the question.</p>

<p>'Some of the Labour Party have,' Ernestine told them, 'but the
others are afraid. They've been told that women are such slaves
to convention&mdash;such timid creatures! They know their own
women aren't, but they're doubtful about the rest. The Labour
Party, you know'&mdash;she spoke with a condescending forbearance&mdash;'the
Labour Party is young yet, and knows what it's like to feel
timid. Some of the Labour men have the wild notion that women
would all vote Conservative.'</p>

<p>'So they would!'</p>

<p>But Ernestine shook her head. 'While we are trying to show
the people who say that, that even if they were right, it would be
no excuse whatever for denying our claim to vote whichever way
we thought best. While we are going to the root of the principle
of the thing, another lot of logical gentlemen are sure to say, "Oh,
it would never do to have women voting. They'd be going in for
all sorts of new-fangled reforms, and the whole place would be
turned upside down!" So between the men who think we'd all
turn Tory and the men who are sure we'd all be Socialists, we don't
seem likely to get very far, unless we do something to show them
we mean to have it for no better reason than just that we're human
beings!'</p>

<p>'Isn't she delightfully&mdash;direct!' whispered Miss Levering,
eager to cull some modest flower of praise.</p>

<p>'Oh, direct enough!' His tone so little satisfied the half-maternal
pride of the other woman that she was almost prepared
for the slighting accent in which he presently asked, 'Is this the
sort of thing that's supposed to convert people to a great constitutional
change?'</p>

<p>'It isn't our women would get the vote,' a workman called out.
'It's the rich women.'</p>

<p>'Is it only the rich men who have the vote?' demanded Ernestine.
'You know it isn't. We are fighting to get the franchise on precisely
the same terms as men.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>For several moments the wrangle went on.</p>

<p>'Would wives have a vote?'</p>

<p>She showed how that could be made a matter of adjustment.
She quoted the lodger franchise and the latch-key decision.</p>

<p>Vida kept glancing at Borrodaile. As still he made no sign,
'Of course,' the lady whispered across the back of the bench, 'of
course, you think she's an abomination, but&mdash;&mdash;?' she paused for
a handsome disavowal. Borrodaile looked at the eager face&mdash;Vida's,
for Miss Blunt's was calm as a May morning. As he did
not instantly speak, 'But you can't deny she's got extremely good
wits.'</p>

<p>He seemed to relent before such persuasiveness. 'She's got a
delicious little face,' he admitted, thinking to say the most.</p>

<p>'Oh, her <i>face</i>! That's scarcely the point.'</p>

<p>'It's always the point.'</p>

<p>'It's the principle that's at stake,' Ernestine was saying. 'The
most out-and-out Socialist among us would welcome the enfranchisement
of six duchesses or all the women born with red hair;
we don't care on what plea the entering wedge gets in. But let
me tell you there aren't any people on earth so blind to their own
interests as just you working men when you oppose or when you
are indifferent to women's having votes. All women suffer&mdash;but
it's the women of your class who suffer most. <i>Isn't</i> it? Don't
you men know&mdash;why, it's notorious!&mdash;that the women of the
working class are worse sweated even than the men?'</p>

<p>'So they are!'</p>

<p>'If you don't believe me, <i>ask</i> them. Here they come.'</p>

<p>It was well contrived&mdash;that point! It struck full in the face
of the homeward-streaming women who had just been let out.</p>

<p>'We know, and you men know&mdash;&mdash;' the speaker nailed her
advantage, 'that even the Government that's being forced to
become a model employer where men are concerned, the very
<i>Government</i> is responsible for sweating thousands of women in
State employments! We know and you know that in those work-rooms
over yonder these very women have been sitting weighed
down by the rumour of a reduction in their wages already so much
below the men's. They've sat there wondering whether they can
risk a strike. Women&mdash;it's notorious,' she flung it out on a wave
of passion, 'women everywhere suffer most from the evils of our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>social system. Why not? They've had no hand in it! Our
social system is the work of men! Yet we must work to uphold
it! this system that crushes us. We must swell the budget, we
must help to pay the bill! What <i>fools</i> we've all been! What
fools we are if we don't do something!'</p>

<p>'Gettin' up rows and goin' to 'Olloway's no good.'</p>

<p>While she justified the course that led to Holloway&mdash;</p>

<p>'Rot! Piffle!' they interjected. One man called out: 'I'd
have some respect for you if you'd carried a bomb into the House
of Commons, but a miserable little scuffle with the police!'</p>

<p>'Here's a gentleman who is inciting us to carry bombs. Now,
that shocks me.'</p>

<p>The crowd recovered its spirits at the notion of the champion-shocker
shocked.</p>

<p>'We've been dreadfully browbeaten about our tactics, but that
gentleman with his bad advice makes our tactics sound as innocent
and reasonable as they actually are. When you talk in that
wild way about bombs&mdash;you&mdash;I may be a hooligan'&mdash;she held
up the delicate pink-and-white face with excellent effect&mdash;'but
you do shock me.'</p>

<p>It wore well this exquisitely humorous jest about shocking a
Suffragette. The whole crowd was one grin.</p>

<p>'I'm specially shocked when I hear a <i>man</i> advocating such a
thing! You men have other and more civilized ways of getting
the Government to pay attention to abuses. Now listen to what
I'm saying: for it's the justification of everything we are going to
do in the future, <i>unless</i> we get what we're asking for! It's this.
Our justification is that men, even poor men, have that powerful
leverage of the vote. You men have no right to resort to violence;
you have a better way. We have <i>no</i> way but agitation. A <i>Liberal</i>
Government that refuses&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Three cheers for the Liberals! Hip, hip&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'My friend, I see you are young,' says Ernestine.</p>

<p>'Lord, wot are you?' the young man hurled back.</p>

<p>'Before I got my political education, when <i>I</i> was young and
innocent, like this gentleman, who still pins his faith to the
Liberals, I, too, hoped great things from them. My friends, it's
a frame of mind we outlive!'&mdash;and her friends shrieked with
delight.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well, it's one way for a girl to amuse herself till she gets married,'
said Borrodaile.</p>

<p>'Why, that's just what the hooligans all say!' laughed Vida.
'And, like you, they think that if a woman wants justice for other
women she must have a grievance of her own. I've heard them
ask Ernestine in Battersea&mdash;she has valiant friends there&mdash;"Oo's
'urt <i>your</i> feelin's?" they say. "Tell me, and I'll punch 'is
'ead." But you aren't here to listen to <i>me</i>!' Vida caught herself
up. 'This is about the deputation of women that waited on the
Prime Minister.'</p>

<p>'Didn't get nothin' out of him!' somebody shouted.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, we did! We got the best speech in favour of Woman's
Suffrage that any of us ever heard.'</p>

<p>'Haw! Haw! Clever ol' fox!'</p>

<p>'&rsquo;E just buttered 'em up! But 'e don't do nothin'.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, he did something!'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'He gave us advice!' They all laughed together at that in the
most friendly spirit in the world. 'Two nice pieces,' Ernestine
held up each hand very much like a school child rejoicing over
slices of cake. 'One we are taking'&mdash;she drew in a hand&mdash;'the
other we aren't'&mdash;she let it fall. 'He said we must win people
to our way of thinking. We're doing it; at a rate that must
astonish, if it doesn't even embarrass him. The other piece of
distinguished advice he gave us was of a more doubtful character.'
Her small hands took it up gingerly. Again she seemed to weigh
it there in the face of the multitude. 'The Prime Minister said
we "must have patience." She threw the worthless counsel into
the air and tossed contempt after it. 'It is man's oldest advice to
woman!'</p>

<p>'All our trouble fur nothin'!' groaned an impish boy.</p>

<p>'We see now that patience has been our bane. If it hadn't been
for this same numbing slavish patience we wouldn't be standing
before the world to-day, political outcasts&mdash;catalogued with
felons and lunatics&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And peers!' called a voice.</p>

<p>'We are <i>done</i> with patience!' said Ernestine, hotly; 'and for
that reason there is at last some hope for the women's cause. Now
Miss Scammell will speak to you.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>A strange thing happened when Miss Scammell got up. She
seemed to leave her attractiveness, such as it was, behind when she
climbed up on the bench. Standing mute, on a level with the rest,
her head deprecatingly on one side, she had pleased. Up there on
the bench, presuming to teach, she woke a latent cruelty in the
mob. They saw she couldn't take care of herself, and so they
'went for her'&mdash;the very same young men who had got up and
given her a choice of the seats they had been at the pains to come
early to secure. To be sure, when, with a smile, she had sat down
only a quarter of an hour before, in the vacated place of one of them,
the other boy promptly withdrew with his pal. It would have been
too compromising to remain alongside the charmer. But when
Miss Scammell stood up on that same bench, she was assumed to
have left the realm of smiles and meaning looks where she was mistress
and at home. She had ventured out into the open, not only
without the sword of pointed speech&mdash;that falls to few&mdash;but this
young lady had not even the armour of absolute earnestness. When
she found that smiling piteously wouldn't do, she proceeded, looking
more and more like a scared white rabbit, to tell about the horrible
cases of lead-poisoning among the girls in certain china and
earthenware works. All that she had to say was true and significant
enough. But it was no use. They jeered and howled her
down for pure pleasure in her misery. She trembled and lost her
thread. She very nearly cried. Vida wondered that the little
chairwoman didn't fly to the rescue. But Ernestine sat quite unmoved
looking in her lap.</p>

<p>'Lamentable exhibition!' said Borrodaile, moving about uneasily.</p>

<p>The odd thing was that Miss Scammell kept on with her prickly
task.</p>

<p>'Why don't you make her sit down?' Vida whispered to Miss
Blunt.</p>

<p>'Because I've got to see what she's made of.'</p>

<p>'But surely you see! She's awful!'</p>

<p>'Not half so bad as lots of men when they first try. If she
weathers this, she'll be a speaker some day.'</p>

<p>At last, having told her story through the interruptions&mdash;told
it badly, brokenly, but to the end&mdash;having given proofs that lead-poisoning
among women was on the increase and read out from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>her poor crumpled, shaking notes, the statistics of infant and still-birth
mortality, the unhappy new helper sat down.</p>

<p>Miss Blunt leaned over, and whispered, 'That's all right! I
was wrong. This is nearly as bad as Hyde Park,' and with that
jumped up to give the crowd a piece of her mind.</p>

<p>They sniggered, but they quieted down, all but one.</p>

<p>'Yes, you are the gentleman, you there with the polo cap, who
doesn't believe in giving a fair hearing. I would like to ask that
man who thinks himself so superior, <i>that</i> one in the grey cap,
whether he is capable of standing up here on this bench and
addressing the crowd.'</p>

<p>'Hear, hear.'</p>

<p>'Yes! Get on the bench. Up with him.'</p>

<p>A slight scrimmage, and an agitated man was observed to be
seeking refuge on the outskirts.</p>

<p>'Bad as Miss Scammell was, she made me rather ashamed of
myself,' Vida confided to Borrodaile.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said sympathetically, 'it always makes one rather
ashamed&mdash;even if it's a man making public failure.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that wasn't what I meant. <i>She</i> at least tried. But I&mdash;I
feel I'm a type of all the idle women the world over. Leaving it
to the poor and the ill-equipped to&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'To keep the world from slipping into chaos?' he inquired
genially.</p>

<p>She hadn't heard. Her eyes were fastened on the chairwoman.</p>

<p>'After all, they've got Ernestine,' Vida exulted under her breath.</p>

<p>Borrodaile fell to studying this aspect of the face whose every
change he had thought he knew so well. What was the new
thing in it? Not admiration merely, not affection alone&mdash;something
almost fierce behind the half-protecting tenderness with which
she watched the chairman's duel with the mob. Borrodaile lifted
a hand&mdash;people were far too engrossed, he knew, to notice&mdash;and
he laid it on Vida's, which had tightened on the back of the bench.</p>

<p>'My dear!' he said wondering and low as one would to wake a
sleepwalker.</p>

<p>She answered without looking at him, 'What is it?'</p>

<p>He seemed not to know quite how to frame his protest.</p>

<p>'She can carry <i>you</i> along at least!' he grumbled. 'You forget
everybody else!'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Vida smiled. It was so plain whom he meant by 'everybody.'
Lord Borrodaile gave a faint laugh. He probably knew that would
'bring her round.' It did. It brought her quick eyes to his face;
it brought low words.</p>

<p>'<i>Please!</i> Don't let her see you&mdash;laughing, I mean.'</p>

<p>'You can explain to her afterwards that it was you I was laughing
at.' As that failed of specific effect, 'You really are a little
ridiculous,' he said again, with the edge in his voice, 'hanging on
the lips of that Backfisch as if she were Demosthenes.'</p>

<p>'We don't think she's a Demosthenes. We know she is something
much more significant&mdash;for <i>us</i>.'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'She's Ernestine Blunt.'</p>

<p>Clean out of patience, he turned his back.</p>

<p>'Am I alone?' she whispered over his shoulder, as if in apology.
'Look at all the other women. Some of them are very intelligent.
Our interest in our fellow-woman seems queer and unnatural to
you because you don't realize Mrs. Brown has always been interested
in Mrs. Jones.'</p>

<p>'Oh, has she?'</p>

<p>'Yes. She hasn't said much to Mr. Brown about it,' Vida
admitted, smiling, because a man's interest in woman is so
limited.'</p>

<p>Borrodaile laughed. 'I didn't know that was his failing!'</p>

<p>'I mean his interest is of one sort. It's confined to the woman
he finds interesting in <i>that</i> way at <i>that</i> minute. Other women
bore him. But other women have always been mightily interesting
to us! Now, sh! let's listen.'</p>

<p>'I can understand those callow youths,' unwarily he persisted;
'she's pink and pert and all the rest, but <i>you</i>&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, will you <i>never</i> understand? Don't you know women are
more civilized than men?'</p>

<p>'Woman! she'll be the last animal domesticated.' It seemed as
if he preferred to have her angry rather than oblivious of him.</p>

<p>But not for nothing did she belong to a world which dares to say
whatever it wants to say.</p>

<p>'We are civilized enough, at all events'&mdash;there was an ominous
sparkle in her eye&mdash;'to listen to men speakers clever or dull&mdash;we
listen quietly enough. But men!&mdash;a person must be of your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>own sex for you to be able to regard him without distraction. If the
woman is beautiful enough, you are intoxicated. If she's plain
enough, you are impatient. All you see in any woman is her sex.
You can't <i>listen</i>.'</p>

<p>'Whew!' remarked Borrodaile.</p>

<p>'But <i>I</i> must listen&mdash;I haven't got over being ashamed to find
how much this girl can teach me.'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry for you that any of Miss Scammell's interesting
speech was lost,' the chairman was saying. 'She was telling you
just the kind of thing that you men ought to know, the kind of
thing you get little chance of knowing about from men. Yet those
wretched girls who die young of lead-poisoning, or live long enough
to bring sickly babies into the world, those poor working women
look to you working men for help. Are they wrong to look to you,
or are they right? You working men represent the majority of
the electorate. <i>You</i> can change things if you will. If you
don't, don't think the woman will suffer alone. We shall all suffer
together. More and more the masters are saying, "We'll get rid
of these men&mdash;they're too many for us with their unions and their
political pull. We'll get women. We'll get them for two-thirds
of what we pay the men. Good business!" say the masters.
But it's bad business&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'For all but the masters,' muttered the tramp.</p>

<p>'Bad for the masters, too,' said the girl, 'only they can't see it,
or else they don't care what sort of world they leave to their children.
If you men weren't so blind, you'd see the women will be
in politics what they are in the home&mdash;your best friends.'</p>

<p>'Haw! haw! Listen at 'er!'</p>

<p>'<i>With</i> the women you would be strong. Without them you
are&mdash;what you are!'</p>

<p>The ringing contempt in her tone was more than one gentleman
could put up with.</p>

<p>'How do you think the world got on before you came to show
it <i>how</i>?'</p>

<p>'It got on very badly. Not only in England&mdash;all over the world
men have insisted on governing alone. What's the result? Misery
and degradation to the masses, and to the few&mdash;the rich and
high-placed&mdash;for them corruption and decline.'</p>

<p>'That's it, always 'ammering away at the men&mdash;pore devils!'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>'Some people are so foolish as to think we are working against
the men.'</p>

<p>'So you are!'</p>

<p>'It's just what the old-school politicians would like you to think.
But it's nonsense. Nobody knows better than we that the best
interests of men and women are identical&mdash;they <i>can't be separated</i>.
It's trying to separate them that's made the whole trouble.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you know it all!'</p>

<p>'Well, you see'&mdash;she put on her most friendly and reasonable
air&mdash;'men have never been obliged to study women's point of
view. But we've been obliged to study the men's point of view.
It's natural we should understand you a great deal better than
you understand us. And though you sometimes disappoint us,
we don't lose hope of you.'</p>

<p>'Thanks awfully.'</p>

<p>'We think that if we can only make you understand the meaning
of this agitation, then you'll help us to get what we want. We
believe the day will come when the old ideal of men standing by
the women&mdash;when that ideal will be realized. For don't believe
it ever <i>has</i> been realized. It never has! Now our last speaker
for to-day will say a few words to you. Mrs. Thomas.'</p>

<p>'Haven't you had about enough?' said Borrodaile, impatiently.</p>

<p>'Don't wait for me,' was all her answer.</p>

<p>'Shall you stay, then, till the bitter end?'</p>

<p>'It will only be a few moments now. I may as well see it out.'</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch, detached it, and held it across the
back of the seat.</p>

<p>She nodded, and repeated, 'Don't wait.'</p>

<p>His answer to that was to turn not only a bored but a slightly
injured face towards the woman who had, not without difficulty,
balanced her rotund form on the bench at the far end. She
might have been the comfortable wife of a rural grocer. She
spoke the good English you may not infrequently hear among
that class, but it became clear, as she went on, that she was a person
of a wider cultivation.</p>

<p>'You'd better go. She'll be stodgy and dull.' Vida spoke with
a real sympathy for her friend's sufferings. 'Oh, portentous dull.'</p>

<p>'And no waist!' sighed Borrodaile, but he sank back in his
corner.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently his wandering eye discovered something in his companion's
aspect that told him subtly she was not listening to the
mauve matron. Neither were some of the others. A number
had moved away, and the little lane their going left was not yet
closed, for the whole general attention was obviously slackened.
This woman wasn't interesting enough even to boo at. The
people who didn't go home began to talk to one another. But
in Vida's face&mdash;what had brought to it that still intensity? Borrodaile
moved so that he could follow the fixed look. One of
the infrequently passing hansoms had stopped. Was she looking
at that? Two laughing people leaning out, straining to
catch what the mauve orator was saying. Suddenly Borrodaile
pulled his slack figure together.</p>

<p>'Sophia!' he ejaculated softly, 'and Stonor!&mdash;by the beard
of the prophet!' He half rose, whether more annoyed or amazed
it would be hard to tell. 'We're discovered!' he said, in a laughing
whisper. As he turned to add 'The murder's out,' he saw
that Vida had quietly averted her face. She was leaning her
head on her hand, so that it masked her features. Even if the
woman who was speaking had not been the object of such interest
as the people in the hansom had to bestow, even had either of
them looked towards Vida's corner, only a hat and a gauze ruffle
would have been seen.</p>

<p>Borrodaile took the hint. His waning sense of the humour of
the situation revived.</p>

<p>'Perhaps, after all, if we lay low,' he said, smiling more broadly.
'It would be nuts for Stonor to catch us sitting at the feet of Mrs.
Thomas.' He positively chuckled at the absurdity of the situation.
He had slipped back into his corner, but he couldn't help craning
his neck to watch those two leaning over the door of the hansom,
while they discussed some point with animation. Several times
the man raised his hand as if to give an order through the trap
door. Each time Sophia laughingly arrested him. 'He wants
to go on,' reported Borrodaile, sympathetically. 'She wants
him to wait a minute. Now he's jumped out. What's he&mdash;looking
for another hansom? No&mdash;now <i>she's</i> out. Bless me,
she's shaking hands with him. He's back in the hansom!&mdash;driving
away. Sophia's actually&mdash;&mdash; 'Pon my soul, I don't
know what's come over the women! I'm rather relieved on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>whole.' He turned round and spoke into Vida's ear. 'I've
been a little sorry for Sophia. She's never had the smallest
interest in any man but that cousin of hers&mdash;and, of course,
it's quite hopeless.'</p>

<p>Vida sat perfectly motionless, back to the speaker, back to the
disappearing hansom, staring at the parapet.</p>

<p>'You can turn round now&mdash;quite safe. Sophia's out of range.
Poor Sophia!' After a little pause, 'Of course you know Stonor?'</p>

<p>'Why, of course.'</p>

<p>'Oh, well, my distinguished cousin used not to be so hard to
get hold of&mdash;not in the old days when we were seeing so much
of your father.'</p>

<p>'That must have been when I was in the schoolroom&mdash;wasn't
it?'</p>

<p>He turned suddenly and looked at her. 'I'd forgotten. You
know Geoffrey, and you don't like him. I saw that once before.'</p>

<p>'Once before?' she echoed.</p>

<p>He reminded her of the time she hurried away from Ulland
House to Bishopsmead.</p>

<p>'<i>I</i> wasn't deceived,' he said, with his look of smiling malice.
'You didn't care two pins about your Cousin Mary and her
influenza.'</p>

<p>Vida moved her expressionless face a little to the right. 'I can
see Sophia. But she's listening to the speech;' and Vida herself,
with something of an effort, seemed now to be following the sordid
experiences of a girl that the speaker had befriended some years
before. It was through this girl, the mauve matron said, that
she herself had come into touch with the abject poor. She took
a big barrack of a house in a poverty-stricken neighbourhood,
and it became known that there she received and helped both
men and women. 'I sympathized with the men, but it was the
things the women told me that appalled me. They were too bad
to be entirely believed, but I wrote them down. They haunted
me. I investigated. I found I had no excuse for doubting those
stories.'</p>

<p>'This woman's a find,' Vida whispered to the chairman.</p>

<p>Ernestine shook her head.</p>

<p>'Why, she's making a first-rate speech!' said Vida, astonished.</p>

<p>'There's nobody here who will care about it.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>'Why do you say that?'</p>

<p>'Oh, all she's saying is a commonplace to these people. Lead-poisoning
was new, to <i>them</i>&mdash;something they could take hold of.'</p>

<p>'Well, I stick to it, you've got a good ally in this woman. Let
her stand up in Somerset Hall, and tell the people&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It wouldn't do,' said the young Daniel, firmly.</p>

<p>'You don't believe her story?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't say the things aren't true. But'&mdash;she moved
uneasily&mdash;'the subject's too prickly.'</p>

<p>'Too prickly for you!'</p>

<p>The girl nodded with an anxious eye on the speaker. 'We
sometimes make a passing reference&mdash;just to set men thinking,
and there leave it. But it always makes them furious, of course.
It does no good. Either people know and just accept it, or else
they won't believe, and it only gets them on the raw. I'll have to
stop her if&mdash;&mdash;' She leaned forward.</p>

<p>'It's odd your taking it like this. I suppose it's because you're
so young,' said Vida, wondering. 'It must be because for you
it isn't real.'</p>

<p>'No, it's because I see no decent woman can think much about
it and keep sane. That's why I say this one won't be any good
to us. She'll never be able to see anything clearly but that one
thing. She'll always be forgetting the main issue.'</p>

<p>'What do you call the main issue?'</p>

<p>'Why, political power, of course.'</p>

<p>'Oh, wise young Daniel!' she murmured, as Miss Blunt touched
the speaker's sleeve and interjected a word into the middle of
a piece of depressing narrative.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thomas stopped, faltered, and pulled herself up with,
'Well, as I say, with my own verifications these experiences form a
body of testimony that should stir the conscience of the community.
I <i>myself</i> felt'&mdash;she glanced at Ernestine&mdash;'I felt it was too ghastly
to publish, but it ought to be used. Those who doubted the evidence
should examine it. I went to a lady who is well known to
be concerned about public questions; her husband is a member
of Parliament, and a person of influence. You don't know,
perhaps, but she did, that there's a Parliamentary Commission
going to sit here in London in a few weeks for the purpose of
inquiring into certain police regulations which greatly concern
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>women. Who do you think are invited to serve on that Commission?
Men. All men. Not a woman in England is being
consulted. The husband of the lady I went to see&mdash;he was one
of the Commissioners. I said to her, "<i>You</i> ought to be serving
on that board." She said, "Oh, no," but that women like her
could influence the men who sat on the Commission.'</p>

<p>'This is better!' whispered the ever-watchful Ernestine, with
a smile.</p>

<p>'So I told her about my ten years' work. I showed her some
of my records&mdash;not the worst, the average, sifted and verified.
She could hardly be persuaded to glance at what I had been at
so much pains to collect. You see'&mdash;she spoke as though in
apology for the lady&mdash;'you see I had no official or recognized
position.'</p>

<p>'Hear, hear,' said Ernestine.</p>

<p>'I was simply a woman whose standing in the community
was all right, but I had nothing to recommend me to serious
attention. I had nothing but the courage to look wrong in the
face, and the conscience to report it honestly. When I told her
certain things&mdash;things that are so stinging a disgrace that no
decent person can hear them unmoved&mdash;when I told her of the
degrading discomforts, the cruelties, that are practised against
homeless women even in some of the rate-supported casual wards
and the mixed lodging-houses, that lady said&mdash;sitting there in
her pleasant drawing-room&mdash;she said it could not be true!
My reports were exaggerated&mdash;women were sentimental&mdash;the
authorities managed these places with great wisdom. They are
so horrible, I said, they drive women to the streets. She assured
me I was mistaken. I asked her if she had ever been inside a
mixed lodging-house. She never had. But the casual wards
she knew about. They were so well managed she herself wouldn't
mind at all spending a night in one of these municipal provisions
for the homeless. Then I said, "You are the woman I am looking
for! Come with me one night and try it. What night shall
it be?" She said she was engaged in writing a book. She could
not interrupt her work. But I said, if those rate-supported places
are so comfortable, it won't interfere with your work. She
<i>turned the conversation</i>. She talked about the Commission. The
Commission was going to make a thorough scientific investigation.
Nothing amateur about the Commission. The lady was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>sincere'&mdash;Mrs. Thomas vouched for it&mdash;'she had a comfortable
faith in the Commission. But, I say'&mdash;the woman leaned forward
in her earnestness&mdash;'I say that Commission will waste its
time! I don't deny it will investigate and discuss the position of
the outcast women of this country. Their plight, which is the
work of men, will once more be inquired into by men. I say
there should be women on that Commission. If the middle and
upper class women have the dignity and influence men pretend
they have, why aren't they represented there? Nobody pretends
the matter doesn't concern the mothers of the nation. It concerns
them horribly. Nobody can think so ill of them as to suppose
they don't care. It's monstrous that men should sit upon
that committee alone. Women have had to think about these
things. We believe this evil can be met&mdash;if men will let us try.
It may be that only women comprehend it, since men through the
ages have been helpless before it. Why, then, once again, this
Commission of <i>men</i>? The mockery of it! Setting men to make
their report upon this matter to men! I am not a public speaker,
but I am a wife and a mother. Do you wonder that hearing
about that Commission gave me courage to take the first opportunity
to join these brave sisters of mine who are fighting for
political liberty?'</p>

<p>She seemed for the first time to notice that a little group of
sniggerers were becoming more obstreperous.</p>

<p>'We knew, of course, that whatever we say some of you will
laugh and jeer; but, speaking for myself, no mockery that you
are able to fling at us, can sting <i>me</i> like the thought of the hypocrisy
of that Commission! Do you wonder that when we think of
it&mdash;you men who have power and don't use it!&mdash;do you wonder
that women come out of their homes&mdash;young, and old, and
middle-aged&mdash;that we stand up here in the public places and
give you scorn for scorn?'</p>

<p>As the unheroic figure trembling stepped off the bench, she
found Vida Levering's hand held out to steady her.</p>

<p>'Take my seat,' said the younger woman.</p>

<p>She stood beside her, for once oblivious of Ernestine, who was
calling for new members, and giving out notices.</p>

<p>Vida bent over the shapeless mauve bundle. 'You asked that
woman to go with you. I wish you'd take me.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>'Ah, my dear, <i>I</i> don't need to go again. I thought to have
that lady see it would do good. Her husband has influence, you
see.'</p>

<p>'But you've just said the men are useless in this matter.'</p>

<p>She had no answer.</p>

<p>'But, I believe,' Vida went on, 'if more women were like you&mdash;if
they looked into the thing&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Very few could stand it.'</p>

<p>'But don't hundreds of poor women "stand" much worse?'</p>

<p>'No; they drink and they die. I was ill for three months after
my first experience even of the tramp ward.'</p>

<p>'Was that the first thing you tried?'</p>

<p>'No. The first thing I tried was putting on a Salvation Army
bonnet, and following the people I wanted to help into the public-houses,
selling the <i>War Cry</i>.'</p>

<p>'May one wear the uniform who isn't a member of the
Army?'</p>

<p>'It isn't usual,' she said slowly. And then, as though to give
the <i>coup de grace</i> to the fine lady's curiosity, 'But that was child's
play. Before I sampled the tramp ward, I covered myself with
Keating's powder from head to foot. It wasn't a bit of good.'</p>

<p>'When may I come and talk to you?'</p>

<p>'Hello, Mrs. Thomas!' Vida turned and found the Lady
Sophia at her side. 'Why, father!&mdash;Oh, I see, Miss Levering.
Well'&mdash;she turned to the woman in the corner&mdash;'how's the
House of Help?'</p>

<p>'Do you know about Mrs. Thomas's work?' Vida asked.</p>

<p>'Well, rather! I collect rents in her district.'</p>

<p>'Oh, do you? You never told me.'</p>

<p>'Why should I tell you?'</p>

<p>Ernestine was dismissing the meeting.</p>

<p>'You are very tired,' said Lord Borrodaile, looking at Vida
Levering's face.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said. 'I'll go now. Come, Sophia!'</p>

<p>'We shall be here on Thursday,' Ernestine was saying, 'at the
same hour, and we hope a great many of you will want to join us.'</p>

<p>'In a trip to 'Olloway? No, thank you!'</p>

<p>Upon that something indistinguishable to the three who were
withdrawing was said in the group that had sniggered through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Mrs. Thomas's speech. Another one of that choice circle gave
a great guffaw. There were still more who were amused, but less
indiscreetly. Three men, looking like gentlemen, paused in the
act of strolling by. They, too, were smiling.</p>

<p>'You laugh!' Ernestine's voice rang out.</p>

<p>'Wait a moment,' said Vida to her companions.</p>

<p>She looked back. It was plain, from Ernestine's face, she was
not going to let the meeting break up on that note.</p>

<p>'Don't you think it a little strange, considering the well-known
chivalry among men&mdash;don't you think it strange that against
no reform the world has ever seen&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Reform! Wot rot!'</p>

<p>'If you don't admit it's reform, call it revolt!' She threw the
red-hot word out among the people as if its fire scorched her.
'Against no revolt has there ever been such a torrent of ridicule
let loose as against the Women's Movement. It almost seems
as if&mdash;in spite of men's well-known protecting tenderness towards
woman&mdash;it almost seems as if there's nothing in this world
so funny to a man as a woman!'</p>

<p>'Haw! Haw! Got it right that time!'</p>

<p>Borrodaile was smiling, too.</p>

<p>'Do you know,' Vida asked, 'who those men are who have just
stopped?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'I believe Ernestine does.'</p>

<p>'Oh, perhaps they're bold bad members of Parliament.'</p>

<p>'Some of us,' she was saying, 'have read a little history. We
have read how every struggle towards freedom has met with
opposition and abuse. We expected to have our share of those
things. But we find that no movement before ours has ever had
so much laughter to face.' Through the renewed merriment
she went on: 'Yes, you wonder I admit that. We don't deny
anything that's true. And I'll tell you another thing! We
aren't made any prouder of our men-folk by the discovery that
behind their old theory of woman as "half angel, half idiot," is
a sneaking feeling that "woman is a huge joke."'</p>

<p>'Or just a little one for a penny like you!'</p>

<p>'Men have imagined&mdash;they imagine still, that we have never
noticed how ridiculous <i>they</i> can be. You see'&mdash;she leaned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>over and spoke confidentially&mdash;'we've never dared break it to
them.'</p>

<p>'Haw! Haw!'</p>

<p>'We know they <i>couldn't bear it</i>.'</p>

<p>'Oh-h!'</p>

<p>'So we've done all our laughing in our sleeves. Yes&mdash;and
some years our sleeves had to be made&mdash;like balloons!' She
pulled out the loose alpaca of her own while the workmen chuckled
with appreciation.</p>

<p>'I bet on Ernestine any'ow', said a young man, with an air
of admitting himself a bold original fellow.</p>

<p>'Well, open laughter is less dangerous laughter. It's even a
guide; it helps us to find out things some of us wouldn't know
otherwise. Lots of women used to be taken in by that talk about
feminine influence and about men's immense respect for them!
But any number of women have come to see that underneath
that old mask of chivalry was a broad grin.&mdash;We are reminded
of that every time the House of Commons talks about us.' She
flung it at the three supercilious strangers. 'The dullest gentleman
there can raise a laugh if he speaks of the "fair sex." Such
jokes!&mdash;even when they are clean such poor little feeble efforts
that even a member of Parliament couldn't laugh at them unless
he had grown up with the idea that woman was somehow essentially
funny&mdash;and that <i>he</i>, oh, no! there was nothing whatever to laugh
at in man. Those members of Parliament don't have the enlightenment
that you men have&mdash;of hearing what women <i>really</i>
think when we hear men laugh as you did just now about our
going to prison. They don't know that we find it just a little
strange'&mdash;she bent over the scattering rabble and gathered it
into a sudden fellowship&mdash;'doesn't it strike you, too, as strange
that when a strong man goes to prison for his convictions it is
thought to be something rather fine (I don't say it is myself&mdash;though
it's the general impression). But when a weak woman
goes for <i>her</i> convictions, men find it very humorous indeed. Our
prisoners have to bear not only the hardships of Holloway Gaol,
but they have to bear the worse pains and penalties inflicted by
the general public. You, too, you laugh! and yet I say'&mdash;she
lifted her arms and spread them out above the people&mdash;'I
say it was not until women were found ready to go to prison&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>not
till then was the success of the cause assured.' Her bright
eyes were shining brighter still with tears.</p>

<p>'If prison's so good fur the cause, why didn't <i>you</i> go?'</p>

<p>'Here's a gentleman who asks why I didn't go to prison. The
answer to that is, I did go.'</p>

<p>She tossed the information down among the cheers and groans
as lightly as though it had no more personal significance for her
than a dropped leaflet setting forth some minor fact.</p>

<p>'That delicate little girl!' breathed Vida.</p>

<p>'You never told <i>me</i> that item in her history,' said Borrodaile.</p>

<p>'She never told me&mdash;never once spoke of it! They put her
in prison!' It was as if she couldn't grasp it.</p>

<p>'Of course one person's going isn't of much consequence,'
Ernestine was winding up with equal spirit and <i>sang-froid</i>. 'But
the fact that dozens and scores&mdash;all sorts and conditions&mdash;are
ready to go&mdash;<i>that</i> matters! And that's the place our reprehensible
tactics have brought the movement to. The meeting is closed.'</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They dropped Sophia at her own door, but Lord Borrodaile
said he would take Vida home. They drove along in silence.</p>

<p>When they stopped before the tall house in Queen Anne's Gate,
Vida held out her hand.</p>

<p>'It's late. I won't ask you in.'</p>

<p>'You are over-tired. Go to bed.'</p>

<p>'I wish I could. I'm dining out.'</p>

<p>He looked at her out of kind eyes. 'It begins to be dreadfully
stuffy in town. I'm glad, after all, we're going on that absurd
yachting trip.'</p>

<p>'I'm not going,' she said.</p>

<p>'Oh, nonsense! Sophia and I would break our hearts.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure about Sophia.'</p>

<p>'It will do you good to come and have a look at the Land of
the Midnight Sun,' he said.</p>

<p>'I'm going to have a look at the Land of Midnight where there's
no sun. And everybody but you and Sophia and my sister will
think I'm in Norway.'</p>

<p>When she explained, he broke out:</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>'It's the very wildest nonsense that ever&mdash;&mdash; It would kill
you.' The intensity of his opposition made him incoherent.
'You, of all women in the world! A creature who can't even
stand people who say "serviette" instead of "table-napkin"!'</p>

<p>'Fancy the little Blunt having been in prison!'</p>

<p>'Oh, let the little Blunt go to&mdash;&mdash;' He checked himself.
'Be reasonable, child.' He turned and looked at her with an
earnestness she had never seen in his eyes before. 'Why in
heaven should <i>you</i>&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why? You heard what that woman said.'</p>

<p>'I heard <i>nothing</i> to account for&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That's partly,' she interrupted, 'why I must make this experiment.
When a man like you&mdash;as good a man as you'&mdash;she
repeated with slow wonder&mdash;'when you and all the other
good men that the world is full of&mdash;when you all know everything
that that woman knows&mdash;and more! and yet see nothing
in it to account for what she feels, and what I&mdash;I too, am beginning
to feel&mdash;&mdash;!' she broke off. 'Good-bye! If I go far on
this new road, it's you I shall have to thank.'</p>

<p>'I?'</p>

<p>He shrugged drearily at the absurd charge, making no motion
to take the offered hand, but sat there in the corner of the hansom
looking rather old and shrunken.</p>

<p>'You and one other,' she said.</p>

<p>That roused him. 'Ah, he has come, then.'</p>

<p>'Who?'</p>

<p>'The other. The man who is going to count.'</p>

<p>Her eyelids drooped. 'The man who was to count most for
me came a long while ago. And a long while ago&mdash;he went.'</p>

<p>Borrodaile looked at her. 'But this&mdash;&mdash; Who is the gentleman
who shares with me the doubtful, I may without undue
modesty say the undeserved, honour of urging you to disappear
into the slums? Who is it?'</p>

<p>'The man who wrote this.'</p>

<p>It was the book he had seen in her hands before the meeting.
He read on the green cover, 'In the Days of the Comet.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that fellow! Well, he's not my novelist, but it's the
keenest intelligence we have applied to fiction.'</p>

<p>'He <i>is</i> my novelist. So I've a right to be sorry he knows noth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>ing
about women. See here! Even in his most rationalized
vision of the New Time, he can't help betraying his old-fashioned
prejudice in favour of the "dolly" view of women. His hero
says, "I prayed that night, let me confess it, to an image I had
set up in my heart, an image that still serves with me as a symbol
for things inconceivable, to a Master Artificer, the unseen captain
of all who go about the building of the world, the making of mankind&mdash;&mdash;"'
Vida's finger skipped, lifting to fall on the heroine's
name. '"Nettie... She never came into the temple of that
worshipping with me."' Swiftly she turned the pages back.
'Where's that other place? Here! The man says to the heroine&mdash;to
his ideal woman he says, "Behind you and above you rises
the coming City of the World, and I am in that building. Dear
heart! you are only happiness!" That's the whole view of man
in a nutshell. Even the highest type of woman such an imagination
as this can conjure up&mdash;&mdash;' She shook her head. '"You
are only happiness, dear"&mdash;a minister of pleasure, negligible in
all the nobler moods, all the times of wider vision or exalted
effort! Tell me'&mdash;she bent her head and looked into her companion's
face with a new passion dawning in her eyes&mdash;'in the
building of that City of the Future, in the making of it beautiful,
shall women really have no share?'</p>

<p>'My dear, I only know that I shall have no share myself.'</p>

<p>'Ah, we don't speak of ourselves.' She opened the hansom
doors and her companion got out. 'But this Comet man,' she
said as she followed, '<i>he</i> might have a share if only he knew why
all the great visions have never yet been more than dreams. That
this man should think foundations can be well and truly laid
when the best of one half the race are "only happiness, dear!"'
She turned on the threshold. '<i>Whose</i> happiness?'</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p>The fall of the Liberal Ministry was said by the simple-minded
to have come as a bolt from the blue. Certainly into the subsequent
General Election were entering elements but little foreseen.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the last two bye-elections before the crash had
resulted in the defeat of the Liberal candidate not by the Tory
antagonist, but in one case by the nominee of the Labour party,
in the other by an independent Socialist. Both these men had
publicly thanked the Suffragettes for their notable share in piling
up those triumphant and highly significant majorities. Now
the country was facing an election where, for the first time in the
history of any great nation, women were playing a part that even
their political enemies could hardly with easy minds call subordinate.</p>

<p>Only faint echoes of the din penetrated the spacious quiet of
Ulland House. Although the frequent week-end party was
there, the great hall on this particular morning presented a deserted
appearance as the tall clock by the staircase chimed the
hour of noon. The insistence of the ancient timepiece seemed
to have set up a rival in destruction of the Sunday peace, for no
sooner had the twelfth stroke died than a bell began to ring.
The little door in the wainscot beyond the clock was opened. An
elderly butler put his head round the huge screen of Spanish
leather that masked the very existence of the modest means of
communication with the quarters of the Ulland domestics. So
little was a ring at the front door expected at this hour that Sutton
was still slowly getting into the left sleeve of his coat when his
mistress appeared from the garden by way of the French window.
The old butler withdrew a discreet instant behind the screen to
put the last touches to his toilet, but Lady John had seen that he
was there.</p>

<p>'Has Miss Levering gone for a walk?' she inquired of the
servant.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>'I don't know, m'lady.'</p>

<p>'She's not in the garden. Do you think she's not down yet?'</p>

<p>'I haven't seen her, m'lady,' said Sutton, emerging from his
retirement and approaching the wide staircase on his way to answer
the front-door bell.</p>

<p>'Never mind'&mdash;his mistress went briskly over to a wide-winged
writing-table and seated herself before a litter of papers&mdash;'I
won't have her disturbed if she's resting,' Lady John said,
adding half to herself, 'she certainly needs it.'</p>

<p>'Yes, m'lady,' said Sutton, adjusting the maroon collar of his
livery which had insisted upon riding up at the back.</p>

<p>'But I want her to know'&mdash;Lady John spoke while glancing
through a letter before consigning it to the wastepaper basket&mdash;'the
moment she comes down she must be told that the new plans
arrived by the morning post.'</p>

<p>'Plans, m'la&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'She'll understand. There they are.' The lady held up a
packet about which she had just snapped an elastic band. 'I'll
put them here. It's very important she should have them in
time to look over before she goes.'</p>

<p>'Yes, m'lady.'</p>

<p>Sutton opened a door and disappeared. A footstep sounded
on the marble floor of the lobby.</p>

<p>Over her shoulder Lady John called out, 'Is <i>that</i> Miss Levering?'</p>

<p>'<i>No</i>, m'lady. Mr. Farnborough.'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I'm scandalously early.' In spite of his words the
young man whipped off his dust coat and flung it to the servant
with as much precipitation as though what he had meant to say
was 'scandalously late.' 'I motored up from Dutfield. It didn't
take me nearly so long as Lord John said.'</p>

<p>The lady had given the young man her hand without rising.
'I'm afraid my husband is no authority on motoring&mdash;and he's
not home yet from church.'</p>

<p>'It's the greatest luck finding <i>you</i>.' Farnborough sat himself
down in the easy-chair on the other side of the wide writing-table
undaunted by its business-like air or the preoccupied look of the
woman before it. 'I thought Miss Levering was the only person
under this roof who was ever allowed to observe Sunday as a real
day of rest.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>'If you've come to see Miss Levering&mdash;&mdash;' began Lady John.</p>

<p>'Is she here? I give you my word I didn't know it.'</p>

<p>'Oh?' said the lady, unconvinced.</p>

<p>'I thought she'd given up coming.'</p>

<p>'Well, she's begun again. She's helping me about something.'</p>

<p>'Oh, helping you, is she?' said Farnborough with absent eyes;
and then suddenly 'all there,' 'Lady John, I've come to ask you
to help <i>me</i>.'</p>

<p>'With Miss Levering?' said Hermione Heriot's aunt. 'I can't
do it.'</p>

<p>'No, no&mdash;all that's no good. She only laughs.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' breathed the lady, relieved, 'she looks upon you as a boy.'</p>

<p>'Such nonsense,' he burst out suddenly. 'What do you think
she said to me the day before she went off yachting?'</p>

<p>'That she was four years older than you?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I knew that. No. She said <i>she</i> knew she was all the
charming things I'd been saying, but there was only one way to
prove it, and that was to marry some one young enough to be her
son. She'd noticed, she said, that was what the <i>most</i> attractive
women did&mdash;and she named names.'</p>

<p>Lady John laughed. '<i>You</i> were too old!'</p>

<p>He nodded. 'Her future husband, she said, was probably
just entering Eton.'</p>

<p>'Exactly like her.'</p>

<p>'No, no.' Dick Farnborough waived the subject away. 'I
wanted to see you about the secretaryship.'</p>

<p>'You didn't get it then?'</p>

<p>'No. It's the grief of my life.'</p>

<p>'Oh, if you don't get one you'll get another.'</p>

<p>'But there <i>is</i> only one,' he said desperately.</p>

<p>'Only one vacancy?'</p>

<p>'Only one man I'd give my ears to work for.'</p>

<p>Lady John smiled. 'I remember.'</p>

<p>He turned his sanguine head with a quick look. 'Do I <i>always</i>
talk about Stonor? Well, it's a habit people have got into.'</p>

<p>'I forget, do you know Mr. Stonor personally, or'&mdash;she smiled
her good-humoured tolerant smile&mdash;'or are you just dazzled from
afar?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I know him! The trouble is he doesn't know me. If
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>he did he'd realize he can't be sure of winning his election without
my valuable services.'</p>

<p>'Geoffrey Stonor's re-election is always a foregone conclusion.'</p>

<p>Farnborough banged his hand on the arm of the chair. 'That
the great man shares that opinion is precisely his weak point'&mdash;then
breaking into a pleasant smile as he made a clean breast
of his hero-worship&mdash;'his <i>only</i> weak point!'</p>

<p>'Oh, you think,' inquired Lady John, lightly, 'just because
the Liberals swept the country the last time, there's danger of
their&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'How can we be sure <i>any</i> Conservative seat is safe, after&mdash;&mdash;'
as Lady John smiled and turned to her papers again. 'Forgive
me,' said the young man, with a tolerant air, 'I know you're not
interested in politics <i>qua</i> politics. But this concerns Geoffrey
Stonor.'</p>

<p>'And you count on my being interested in him like all the rest?'</p>

<p>He leaned forward. 'Lady John, I've heard the news.'</p>

<p>'What news?'</p>

<p>'That your little niece, the Scotch heiress, is going to marry him.'</p>

<p>'Who told you that?'</p>

<p>She dropped the paper she had picked up and stared. No
doubt about his having won her whole attention at last.</p>

<p>'Please don't mind my knowing.'</p>

<p>But Lady John was visibly perturbed. 'Jean had set her
heart on having a few days with just her family in the secret,
before the flood of congratulation broke loose.'</p>

<p>'Oh, <i>that's</i> all right,' he said soothingly. 'I always hear things
before other people.'</p>

<p>'Well, I must ask you to be good enough to be very circumspect.'
Lady John spoke gravely. 'I wouldn't have my niece or
Mr. Stonor think that any of us&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, of course not.'</p>

<p>'She'll suspect something if you so much as mention Stonor;
and you can't help mentioning Stonor!'</p>

<p>'Yes, I can. Besides I shan't see her!'</p>

<p>'But you will'&mdash;Lady John glanced at the clock. 'She'll be
here in an hour.'</p>

<p>He jumped up delighted. 'What? To-day. The future
Mrs. Stonor!'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes,' said his hostess, with a harassed air. 'Unfortunately
we had one or two people already asked for the week and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And I go and invite myself to luncheon! Lady John.' He
pushed back the armchair like one who clears the field for action.
He stood before her with his legs wide apart, and a look of enterprise
on his face. 'You can buy me off! I'll promise to remove
myself in five minutes if you'll put in a word for me.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' Lady John shook her head. 'Mr. Stonor inspires
a similar enthusiasm in so many young&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'They haven't studied the situation as I have.' He sat down
to explain his own excellence. 'They don't know what's at stake.
They don't go to that hole Dutfield, as I did, just to hear his
Friday speech.'</p>

<p>'But you were rewarded. My niece, Jean, wrote me it was
"glorious."'</p>

<p>'Well, you know, I was disappointed,' he said judicially. 'Stonor's
too content just to criticize, just to make his delicate pungent
fun of the men who are grappling&mdash;very inadequately of course&mdash;still
<i>grappling</i> with the big questions. There's a carrying
power'&mdash;he jumped to his feet again and faced an imaginary
audience&mdash;'some of Stonor's friends ought to point it out&mdash;there's
a driving power in the poorest constructive policy that
makes the most brilliant criticism look barren.'</p>

<p>She regarded the budding politician with good-humoured malice.</p>

<p>'Who told you that?'</p>

<p>'You think there's nothing in it because <i>I</i> say it. But now
that he's coming into the family, Lord John or somebody really
ought to point out&mdash;Stonor's overdoing his r&ocirc;le of magnificent
security.'</p>

<p>The lady sat very straight. 'I don't see even Lord John offering
to instruct Mr. Stonor,' she said, with dignity.</p>

<p>'Believe me, that's just Stonor's danger! Nobody saying a
word, everybody hoping he's on the point of adopting some
definite line, something strong and original, that's going to fire
the public imagination and bring the Tories back into power&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'So he will.'</p>

<p>'Not if he disappoints meetings,' said Farnborough, hotly;
'not if he goes calmly up to town, and leaves the field to the Liberals.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>'When did he do anything like that?'</p>

<p>'Yesterday!' Farnborough flung out the accusation as he
strode up and down before the divan. 'And now he's got this
other preoccupation&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You mean&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Yes, your niece&mdash;the spoilt child of fortune.' Farnborough
stopped suddenly and smacked his forehead. 'Of <i>course</i>!'&mdash;he
wheeled round upon Lady John with accusing face&mdash;'I understand
it now. <i>She</i> kept him from the meeting last night! <i>Well!</i>'&mdash;he
collapsed in the nearest chair&mdash;'if that's the effect she's
going to have, it's pretty serious!'</p>

<p>'You are,' said his hostess.</p>

<p>'I can assure you the election agent's more so. He's simply
tearing his hair.'</p>

<p>She had risen. 'How do you know?' she asked more gravely.</p>

<p>'He told me so himself, yesterday. I scraped acquaintance
with the agent, just to see if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I see,' she smiled. 'It's not only here that you man&oelig;uvre
for that secretaryship!'</p>

<p>As Lady John moved towards the staircase she looked at the
clock. Farnborough jumped up and followed her, saying confidentially&mdash;</p>

<p>'You see, you can never tell when your chance might come.
The election chap's promised to keep me posted. Why, I've
even taken the trouble to arrange with the people at the station
to receive any message that might come over from Dutfield.'</p>

<p>'For you?' She smiled at his self-importance.</p>

<p>Breathlessly he hurried on: 'Immense unexpected pressure
of work, you know&mdash;now that we've forced the Liberals to appeal
to the country&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He stopped as the sound of light steps came flying through
the lobby, and a young girl rushed into the hall calling out gaily&mdash;</p>

<p>'Aunt Ellen! Here I&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She stopped precipitately, and her outstretched arms fell to
her sides. A radiant, gracious figure, she stood poised an instant,
the light of gladness in her eyes only partially dimmed by
the horrid spectacle of an interloper in the person of a strange
young man.</p>

<p>'My darling Jean!'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady John went forward and kissed her at the moment that
the master of the house came hurrying in from the garden with
a cheerful&mdash;</p>

<p>'I <i>thought</i> that was you running up the avenue!'</p>

<p>'Uncle, dear!'</p>

<p>The pretty vision greeted him with the air of a privileged child
of the house, interrupting only for an instant the babel of cross-purpose
explanation about carriages and trains.</p>

<p>Lord John had shaken hands with Dick Farnborough and
walked him towards the window, saying through the torrent&mdash;</p>

<p>'Now they'll tell each other for the next ten minutes that she's
an hour earlier than we expected.'</p>

<p>Although young Farnborough had looked upon the blooming
addition to the party with an undisguised interest, he readily
fell in with Lord John's diplomatic move to get him out of the
way. He even helped towards his own effacement, looking out
through the window with&mdash;</p>

<p>'The Freddy Tunbridges said they were coming to you this
week.'</p>

<p>'Yes, they're dawdling through the park with the Church
Brigade.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'll go and meet them;' and Farnborough disappeared.</p>

<p>As Lord John turned back to his two ladies he offered it as his
opinion&mdash;</p>

<p>'That discreet young man will get on.'</p>

<p>'But <i>how</i> did you get here?' Lady John was still wondering.</p>

<p>Breathless, the girl answered, 'He motored me down.'</p>

<p>'Geoffrey Stonor?'</p>

<p>She nodded, beaming.</p>

<p>'Why, where is he then?'</p>

<p>'He dropped me at the end of the avenue, and went on to see
a supporter about something.'</p>

<p>'You let him go off like that!' Lord John reproached her.</p>

<p>'Without ever&mdash;&mdash;' Lady John interrupted herself to take
Jean's two hands in hers. 'Just tell me, my child, is it all right?'</p>

<p>'My engagement? Absolutely.'</p>

<p>Such radiant security shone in the soft face that the older
woman, drawing the girl down beside her on the divan, dared
to say&mdash;</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>'Geoffrey Stonor isn't going to be&mdash;a little too old for you.'</p>

<p>Jean chimed out the gayest laugh in the world. 'Bless me!
am I such a chicken?'</p>

<p>'Twenty-four used not to be so young, but it's become so.'</p>

<p>'Yes, we don't grow up so quick,' she agreed merrily. 'But,
on the other hand, we <i>stay</i> up longer.'</p>

<p>'You've got what's vulgarly called "looks," my dear,' said her
uncle, 'and that will help to <i>keep</i> you up.'</p>

<p>'I know what Uncle John's thinking,' she turned on him with
a pretty air of challenge. 'But I'm not the only girl who's been
left "what's vulgarly called" money.'</p>

<p>'You're the only one of our immediate circle who's been left
so beautifully much.'</p>

<p>'Ah! but remember, Geoffrey could&mdash;everybody <i>knows</i> he
could have married any one in England.'</p>

<p>'I am afraid everybody does know it,' said her ladyship, faintly
ironic, 'not excepting Mr. Stonor.'</p>

<p>'Well, how spoilt is the great man?' inquired Lord John, mischievously.</p>

<p>'Not the least little bit in the world. You'll see! He so wants
to know my best-beloved relations better.' She stopped to bestow
another embrace on Lady John. 'An orphan has so few belongings,
she has to make the most of them.'</p>

<p>'Let us hope he'll approve of us on further acquaintance.'</p>

<p>'Oh, he will! He's an angel. Why, he gets on with my grandfather!'</p>

<p>'Does he?' said her aunt, unable to forbear teasing her a little.
'You mean to say Mr. Geoffrey Stonor isn't just a tiny bit
"superior" about Dissenters.'</p>

<p>'Not half as much so as Uncle John, and all the rest of you!
My grandfather's been ill again, you know, and rather difficult&mdash;bless
him! but Geoffrey&mdash;&mdash;' she clasped her hands to fill out
her wordless content with him.</p>

<p>'Geoffrey <i>must</i> have powers of persuasion, to get that old Covenanter
to let you come in an abhorred motor-car, on Sunday, too!'</p>

<p>Jean pursed her red lips and put up a cautionary finger with
a droll little air of alarm.</p>

<p>'Grandfather didn't know!' she half whispered.</p>

<p>'Didn't know?'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>'I honestly meant to come by train,' she hastened to exculpate
herself. 'Geoffrey met me on my way to the station. We had
the most glorious run! Oh, Aunt Ellen, we're so happy!' She
pressed her cheek against Lady John's shoulder. 'I've so looked
forward to having you to myself the whole day just to talk to you
about&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Lord John turned away with affected displeasure. 'Oh, very
well&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She jumped up and caught him affectionately by the arm.
'<i>You'd</i> find it dreffly dull to hear me talk about Geoffrey the
whole blessed day!'</p>

<p>'Well, till luncheon, my dear&mdash;&mdash;' Lady John had risen with
a glance at the clock. 'You mustn't mind if I&mdash;&mdash;' She broke
off and went to the writing-table, saying aside to her husband,
'I'm beginning to feel a little anxious; Miss Levering wasn't
only tired last night, she was ill.'</p>

<p>'I thought she looked very white,' said Lord John.</p>

<p>'Oh, dear! Have you got other people?' demanded the happy
egoist.</p>

<p>'One or two. Your uncle's responsible for asking that old
cynic, St. John Greatorex, and I'm responsible for&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Jean stopped in the act of taking off her long gloves. 'Mr.
Greatorex! He's a Liberal, isn't he?' she said with sudden
gravity.</p>

<p>'Little Jean!' Lord John chuckled, 'beginning to "think in
parties!"'</p>

<p>'It's very natural now that she should&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I only meant it was odd he should be <i>here</i>. Of course I'm
not so silly&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It's all right, my child,' said her uncle, kindly. 'We naturally
expect now that you'll begin to think like Geoffrey Stonor, and
to feel like Geoffrey Stonor, and to talk like Geoffrey Stonor.
And quite proper, too!'</p>

<p>'Well,'&mdash;Jean quickly recovered her smiles&mdash;'if I <i>do</i> think
with my husband, and feel with him&mdash;as of course I shall&mdash;it
will surprise me if I ever find myself talking a tenth as well!'
In her enthusiasm she followed her uncle to the French window.
'You should have heard him at Dutfield.' She stopped short.
'The Freddy Tunbridges!' she exclaimed, looking out into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>garden. A moment later her gay look fell. 'What? Not Aunt
Lydia! Oh-h!' She glanced back reproachfully at Lady
John, to find her making a discreet motion of 'I couldn't help it!'
as the party from the garden came in.</p>

<p>The greetings of the Freddys were cut short by Mrs. Heriot,
who embraced her niece with a significant warmth.</p>

<p>'<i>I</i> wasn't surprised,' she said <i>sotto voce</i>. 'I always prophesied&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Sh&mdash;<i>Please</i>&mdash;&mdash;' the girl escaped.</p>

<p>'We haven't met since you were in short skirts,' said the young
man who had been watching his opportunity. 'I'm Dick Farnborough.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I remember.' Jean gave him her hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Freddy was looking round and asking where was the
Elusive One?</p>

<p>'Who is the Elusive One?' Jean demanded.</p>

<p>'Lady John's new ally in good works!' said Mrs. Freddy.
'Why, you met her one day at my house before you went back
to Scotland.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you mean Miss Levering.'</p>

<p>'Yes; nice creature, isn't she?' said Lord John, benevolently.</p>

<p>'I used rather to love her,' said Mrs. Freddy, brightly, 'but
she doesn't come to us any more. She seems to be giving up
going anywhere, except here, so far as I can make out.'</p>

<p>'She knows she can rest here,' said Lady John.</p>

<p>'What does she do to tire her?' demanded Mr. Freddy. 'Hasn't
she been amusing herself in Norway?'</p>

<p>'Since she came back she's been helping my sister and me with
a scheme of ours,' said Lady John.</p>

<p>'She certainly knows how to juggle money out of the men!'
admitted Mrs. Heriot.</p>

<p>'It would sound less equivocal, Lydia, if you added that the
money is to build baths in our Shelter for Homeless Women.'</p>

<p>'Homeless women?' echoed Mr. Freddy.</p>

<p>'Yes; in the most insanitary part of Soho.'</p>

<p>'Oh&mdash;a&mdash;really.' Mr. Freddy stroked his smart little moustache.</p>

<p>'It doesn't sound quite in Miss Levering's line,' Farnborough
hazarded.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>'My dear boy,' said his hostess, 'you know as little about what's
in a woman's line as most men.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I say!' Mr. Freddy looked round with a laugh.</p>

<p>Lord John threw out his chest and dangled his eyeglass with
an indulgent air.</p>

<p>'Philanthropy,' he said, 'in a woman like Miss Levering, is
a form of restlessness. But she's a <i>nice</i> creature. All she needs
is to get some "nice" fella to marry her!'</p>

<p>Mrs. Freddy laughingly hooked herself on her husband's arm.</p>

<p>'Yes; a woman needs a balance wheel, if only to keep her from
flying back to town on a hot day like this.'</p>

<p>'Who,' demanded the host, 'is proposing anything so&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The Elusive One,' said Mrs. Freddy.</p>

<p>'Not Miss&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes; before luncheon.'</p>

<p>Dick Farnborough glanced quickly at the clock, and then his
eyes went questing up the great staircase. Lady John had met
the chorus of disapproval with&mdash;</p>

<p>'She must be in London by three, she says.'</p>

<p>Lord John stared. '<i>To-day?</i> Why she only came late last
night! What must she go back for, in the name of&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well, <i>that</i> I didn't ask her. But it must be something important,
or she would stay and talk over the plans for the new Shelter.'</p>

<p>Farnborough had pulled out his cigarette case and stepped
out through the window into the garden. But he went not as
one who means to take a stroll and enjoy a smoke, rather as a man
on a mission.</p>

<p>A few minutes after, the desultory conversation in the hall was
arrested by the sound of voices near the windows.</p>

<p>They were in full view now&mdash;Vida Levering, hatless, a cool
figure in pearl-grey with a red umbrella; St. John Greatorex,
wearing a Panama hat, talking and gesticulating with a small
book, in which his fingers still kept the place; Farnborough, a
little supercilious, looking on.</p>

<p>'I protest! Good Lord! what are the women of this country
coming to? I <i>protest</i> against Miss Levering being carried indoors
to discuss anything so revolting.'</p>

<p>As Lord John moved towards the window the vermilion disk
of the umbrella closed and dropped like a poppy before it blooms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
As the owner of it entered the hall, Greatorex followed in her
wake, calling out&mdash;</p>

<p>'Bless my soul! what can a woman like you <i>know</i> about such
a thing?'</p>

<p>'Little enough,' said Miss Levering, smiling and scattering
good-mornings.</p>

<p>'I should think so indeed!' He breathed a sigh of relief and
recovered his waggishness. 'It's all this fellow Farnborough's
wicked jealousy&mdash;routing us out of the summer-house where we
were sitting, <i>perfectly</i> happy&mdash;weren't we?'</p>

<p>'Ideally,' said the lady.</p>

<p>'There. You hear!'</p>

<p>He interrupted Lord John's inquiry as to the seriousness of
Miss Levering's unpopular and mysterious programme for the
afternoon. But the lady quietly confirmed it, and looked over
her hostess's shoulder at the plan-sheet that Lady John was
silently holding out between two extended hands.</p>

<p>'Haled indoors on a day like this'&mdash;Greatorex affected a
mighty scorn of the document&mdash;'to talk about&mdash;Public Sanitation,
forsooth! Why, God bless my soul, do you realize that's
<i>drains</i>!'</p>

<p>'I'm dreadfully afraid it is,' said Miss Levering, smiling down
at the architectural drawing.</p>

<p>'And we in the act of discussing Italian literature!' Greatorex
held out the little book with an air of comic despair. 'Perhaps
you'll tell me that isn't a more savoury topic for a lady.'</p>

<p>'But for the tramp population less conducive to savouriness&mdash;don't
you think&mdash;than baths?' She took the book from him,
shutting her handkerchief in the place where his finger had been.</p>

<p>'No, no'&mdash;Greatorex, Panama in hand, was shaking his piebald
head&mdash;'I can't understand this morbid interest in vagrants.
You're too&mdash;much too&mdash;&mdash; Leave it to others!'</p>

<p>'What others?'</p>

<p>'Oh, the sort of woman who smells of india-rubber,' he said,
with smiling impertinence. 'The typical English spinster. You've
seen her. Italy's full of her. She never goes anywhere without
a mackintosh and a collapsible bath&mdash;<i>rubber</i>. When you look
at her it's borne in upon you that she doesn't only smell of rubber.
She is rubber, too.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>They all laughed.</p>

<p>'Now you frivolous people go away,' Lady John said. 'We've
only got a few minutes to talk over the terms of the late Mr. Barlow's
munificence before the carriage comes for Miss Levering.'</p>

<p>In the midst of the general movement to the garden, Mrs. Freddy
asked Farnborough did he know she'd got that old horror to give
Lady John &pound;8000 for her charity before he died?</p>

<p>'Who got him to?' demanded Greatorex.</p>

<p>'Miss Levering,' answered Lady John. 'He wouldn't do it
for me, but she brought him round.'</p>

<p>'Bah-ee Jove!' said Freddy. 'I expect so.'</p>

<p>'Yes.' Mrs. Freddy beamed in turn at her lord and at Farnborough
as she strolled with them through the window. '<i>Isn't</i>
she wonderful?'</p>

<p>'Too wonderful,' said Greatorex to the lady in question, lowering
his voice, 'to waste your time on the wrong people.'</p>

<p>'I shall waste less of my time after this.' Miss Levering spoke
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'I'm relieved to hear it. I can't see you wheedling money for
shelters and rot of that sort out of retired grocers.'</p>

<p>'You see, you call it rot. We couldn't have got &pound;8000 out of
<i>you</i>.'</p>

<p>Speaking still lower, 'I'm not sure,' he said slyly.</p>

<p>She looked at him.</p>

<p>'If I gave you that much&mdash;for your little projects&mdash;what
would you give me?' he demanded.</p>

<p>'Barlow didn't ask that.' She spoke quietly.</p>

<p>'Barlow!' he echoed, with a truly horrified look. 'I should
think not!'</p>

<p>'Barlow!' Lord John caught up the name on his way out
with Jean. 'You two still talking Barlow? How flattered the
old beggar'd be! Did you hear'&mdash;he turned back and linked
his arm in Greatorex's&mdash;'did you hear what Mrs. Heriot said
about him? "So kind, so munificent&mdash;so <i>vulgar</i>, poor soul,
we couldn't know him in London&mdash;but we shall meet him in
heaven!"'</p>

<p>The two men went out chuckling.</p>

<p>Jean stood hesitating a moment, glancing through the window
at the laughing men, and back at the group of women, Mrs. Heriot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>seated magisterially at the head of the writing-table, looking with
inimical eyes at Miss Levering, who stood in the middle of the
hall with head bent over the plan.</p>

<p>'Sit here, my dear,' Lady John called to her. Then with a
glance at her niece, 'You needn't stay, Jean; this won't interest
you.'</p>

<p>Miss Levering glanced over her shoulder as she moved to the
chair opposite Lady John, and in the tone of one agreeing with
the dictum just uttered, 'It's only an effort to meet the greatest
evil in the world,' she said, and sat down with her back to the
girl.</p>

<p>'What do you call the greatest evil in the world?' Jean asked.</p>

<p>A quick look passed between Mrs. Heriot and Lady John.</p>

<p>Miss Levering answered without emphasis, 'The helplessness
of women.'</p>

<p>The girl still stood where the phrase had arrested her.</p>

<p>After a moment's hesitation, Lady John went over to her and
put an arm about her shoulder.</p>

<p>'I know, darling, you can think of nothing but "him," so just
go&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Indeed, indeed,' interrupted the girl, brightly, 'I can think
of everything better than I ever did before. He has lit up everything
for me&mdash;made everything vivider, more&mdash;more significant.'</p>

<p>'Who has?' Miss Levering asked, turning round.</p>

<p>As though she had not heard, Jean went on, 'Oh, yes, I don't
care about other things less but a thousand times more.'</p>

<p>'You <i>are</i> in love,' said Lady John.</p>

<p>'Oh, that's it. I congratulate you.' Over her shoulder Miss
Levering smiled at the girl.</p>

<p>'Well, now'&mdash;Lady John returned to the outspread plan&mdash;'<i>this</i>,
you see, obviates the difficulty you raised.'</p>

<p>'Yes, it's a great improvement,' Miss Levering agreed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Heriot, joining in for the first time, spoke with emphasis&mdash;</p>

<p>'But it's going to cost a great deal more.'</p>

<p>'It's worth it,' said Miss Levering.</p>

<p>'But we'll have nothing left for the organ at St. Pilgrim's.'</p>

<p>'My dear Lydia,' said Lady John, 'we're putting the organ
aside.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>'We can't afford to "put aside" the elevating influence of
music.' Mrs. Heriot spoke with some asperity.</p>

<p>'What we must make for, first, is the cheap and humanely
conducted lodging-house.'</p>

<p>'There are several of those already; but poor St. Pilgrim's&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'There are none for the poorest women,' said Miss Levering.</p>

<p>'No; even the excellent Barlow was for multiplying Rowton
Houses. You can never get men to realize&mdash;you can't always
get women&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It's the work least able to wait,' said Miss Levering.</p>

<p>'I don't agree with you,' Mrs. Heriot bridled, 'and I happen to
have spent a great deal of my life in works of charity.'</p>

<p>'Ah, then,'&mdash;Miss Levering lifted her eyes from the map to
Mrs. Heriot's face&mdash;'you'll be interested in the girl I saw dying
in a tramp ward a little while ago. <i>Glad</i> her cough was worse,
only she mustn't die before her father. Two reasons. Nobody
but her to keep the old man out of the workhouse, and "father
is so proud." If she died first, he would starve&mdash;worst of all,
he might hear what had happened up in London to his girl.'</p>

<p>With an air of profound suspicion, Mrs. Heriot interrupted&mdash;</p>

<p>'She didn't say, I suppose, how she happened to fall so low?'</p>

<p>'Yes, she did. She had been in service. She lost the train
back one Sunday night, and was too terrified of her employer
to dare to ring him up after hours. The wrong person found her
crying on the platform.'</p>

<p>'She should have gone to one of the Friendly Societies.'</p>

<p>'At eleven at night?'</p>

<p>'And there are the Rescue Leagues. I myself have been connected
with one for twenty years&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Twenty years!' echoed Miss Levering. 'Always arriving
"after the train's gone,"&mdash;after the girl and the wrong person
have got to the journey's end.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Heriot's eyes flashed, but before she could speak Jean
asked&mdash;</p>

<p>'Where is she now?'</p>

<p>'Never mind.' Lady John turned again to the plan.</p>

<p>'Two nights ago she was waiting at a street corner in the rain.</p>

<p>'Near a public-house, I suppose?' Mrs. Heriot threw in.</p>

<p>'Yes; a sort of public-house. She was plainly dying. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>was told she shouldn't be out in the rain. "I mustn't go in yet,"
she said. "<i>This</i> is what he gave me," and she began to cry. In
her hand were two pennies silvered over to look like half-crowns.'</p>

<p>'I don't believe that story!' Mrs. Heriot announced. 'It's
just the sort of thing some sensation-monger trumps up. Now,
who tells you these&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Several credible people. I didn't believe them till&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Till?' Jean came nearer.</p>

<p>'Till I saw for myself.'</p>

<p>'<i>Saw?</i>' exclaimed Mrs. Heriot. 'Where&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'In a low lodging-house not a hundred yards from the church
you want a new organ for.'</p>

<p>'How did <i>you</i> happen to be there?'</p>

<p>'I was on a pilgrimage.'</p>

<p>'A pilgrimage?' echoed Jean.</p>

<p>Miss Levering nodded. 'Into the Underworld.'</p>

<p>'<i>You</i> went!' Even Lady John was aghast.</p>

<p>'How could you?' Jean whispered.</p>

<p>'I put on an old gown and a tawdry hat&mdash;&mdash;' She turned
suddenly to her hostess. 'You'll never know how many things
are hidden from a woman in good clothes. The bold free look
of a man at a woman he believes to be destitute&mdash;you must <i>feel</i>
that look on you before you can understand&mdash;a good half of
history.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Heriot rose as her niece sat down on the footstool just
below the writing-table.</p>

<p>'Where did you go&mdash;dressed like that?' the girl asked.</p>

<p>'Down among the homeless women, on a wet night, looking
for shelter.'</p>

<p>'Jean!' called Mrs. Heriot.</p>

<p>'No wonder you've been ill,' Lady John interposed hastily.</p>

<p>'And it's like <i>that</i>?' Jean spoke under her breath.</p>

<p>'No,' came the answer, in the same hushed tone.</p>

<p>'No?'</p>

<p>'It's so much worse I dare not tell about it, even if you weren't
here I couldn't.'</p>

<p>But Mrs. Heriot's anger was unappeased. 'You needn't suppose,
darling, that those wretched creatures feel it as we
would.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Levering raised grave eyes. 'The girls who need shelter
and work aren't <i>all</i> serving-maids.'</p>

<p>'We know,' said Mrs. Heriot, with an involuntary flash, 'that
all the women who make mistakes aren't.'</p>

<p>'That is why <i>every</i> woman ought to take an interest in this,'
said Miss Levering, steadily; 'every girl, too.'</p>

<p>'Yes. Oh, yes!' Jean agreed.</p>

<p>'No.' Lady John was very decisive. 'This is a matter for
us older&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Or for a person who has some special knowledge,' Mrs. Heriot
amended, with an air of sly challenge. '<i>We</i> can't pretend to
have access to such sources of information as Miss Levering.'</p>

<p>'Yes, you can'&mdash;she met Mrs. Heriot's eye&mdash;'for I can give
you access. As you suggest, I have some personal knowledge
about homeless girls.'</p>

<p>'Well, my dear'&mdash;with a manufactured cheerfulness Lady
John turned it aside&mdash;'it will all come in convenient.' She
tapped the plan.</p>

<p>Miss Levering took no notice. 'It once happened to me to
take offence at an ugly thing that was going on under my father's
roof. Oh, <i>years</i> ago! I was an impulsive girl. I turned my
back on my father's house.'</p>

<p>'That was ill-advised.' Lady John glanced at her niece.</p>

<p>'So all my relations said'&mdash;Miss Levering, too, looked at
Jean&mdash;'and I couldn't explain.'</p>

<p>'Not to your mother?' the girl asked.</p>

<p>'My mother was dead. I went to London to a small hotel,
and tried to find employment. I wandered about all day and
every day from agency to agency. I was supposed to be educated.
I'd been brought up partly in Paris, I could play several
instruments and sing little songs in four different tongues.'</p>

<p>In the pause Jean asked, 'Did nobody want you to teach French
or sing the little songs?'</p>

<p>'The heads of schools thought me too young. There were
people ready to listen to my singing. But the terms, they were
too hard. Soon my money was gone. I began to pawn my
trinkets. <i>They</i> went.'</p>

<p>'And still no work?'</p>

<p>'No; but by that time I had some real education&mdash;an unpaid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>hotel bill, and not a shilling in the world. Some girls think it
hardship to have to earn their living. The horror is not to be
allowed to.'</p>

<p>Jean bent forward. 'What happened?'</p>

<p>Lady John stood up. 'My dear,' she asked her visitor, 'have
your things been sent down?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I am quite ready, all but my hat.'</p>

<p>'Well?' insisted Jean.</p>

<p>'Well, by chance I met a friend of my family.'</p>

<p>'That was lucky.'</p>

<p>'I thought so. He was nearly ten years older than I. He
said he wanted to help me.' Again she paused.</p>

<p>'And didn't he?' Jean asked.</p>

<p>Lady John laid her hand on Miss Levering's shoulder.</p>

<p>'Perhaps, after all, he did,' she said. 'Why do I waste time
over myself? I belonged to the little class of armed women.
My body wasn't born weak, and my spirit wasn't broken by the
<i>habit</i> of slavery. But, as Mrs. Heriot was kind enough to hint,
I do know something about the possible fate of homeless girls.
What was true a dozen years ago is true to-day. There are pleasant
parks, museums, free libraries in our great rich London, and
not one single place where destitute women can be sure of work
that isn't killing, or food that isn't worse than prison fare. That's
why women ought not to sleep o' nights till this Shelter stands
spreading out wide arms.'</p>

<p>'No, no,' said the girl, jumping up.</p>

<p>'Even when it's built,'&mdash;Mrs. Heriot was angrily gathering
up her gloves, her fan and her Prayer-book&mdash;'you'll see! Many
of those creatures will prefer the life they lead. They <i>like</i> it.
A woman told me&mdash;one of the sort that knows&mdash;told me many
of them like it so much that they are indifferent to the risk of
being sent to prison. "<i>It gives them a rest</i>,"' she said.</p>

<p>'A rest!' breathed Lady John, horror-struck.</p>

<p>Miss Levering glanced at the clock as she rose to go upstairs,
while Lady John and Mrs. Heriot bent their heads over the plan
covertly talking.</p>

<p>Jean ran forward and caught the tall grey figure on the lower step.</p>

<p>'I want to begin to understand something of&mdash;&mdash;,' she began
in a beseeching tone. 'I'm horribly ignorant.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Levering looked down upon her searchingly. 'I'm a
rather busy person,' she said.</p>

<p>'I have a quite special reason for wanting <i>not</i> to be ignorant.
I'll go to town to-morrow,' said Jean, impulsively, 'if you'll come
and lunch with me&mdash;or let me come to you.'</p>

<p>'Jean!' It was Aunt Lydia's voice.</p>

<p>'I must go and put my hat on,' said Miss Levering, hurrying
up the stair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Heriot bent towards her sister and half whispered, 'How
little she minds talking about horrors!'</p>

<p>'They turn me cold. Ugh! I wonder if she's signed the
visitor's book.' Lady John rose with harassed look. 'Such
foolishness John's new plan of keeping it in the lobby. It's
twice as likely to be forgotten.'</p>

<p>'For all her Shelter schemes, she's a hard woman,' said Aunt
Lydia.</p>

<p>'Miss Levering is!' exclaimed Jean.</p>

<p>'Oh, of course <i>you</i> won't think so. She has angled very adroitly
for your sympathy.'</p>

<p>'She doesn't look&mdash;&mdash;' protested the girl.</p>

<p>Lady John, glancing at her niece, seemed in some intangible
way to take alarm.</p>

<p>'I'm not sure but what she does. Her mouth&mdash;always like
this&mdash;as if she were holding back something by main force.'</p>

<p>'Well, so she is,' slipped out from between Aunt Lydia's thin
lips as Lady John disappeared into the lobby.</p>

<p>'Why haven't I seen Miss Levering before this summer?'
Jean asked.</p>

<p>'Oh, she's lived abroad.' The lady was debating with herself.
'You don't know about her, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'I don't know how Aunt Ellen came across her, if that's what
you mean.'</p>

<p>'Her father was a person everybody knew. One of his daughters
made a very good marriage. But this one&mdash;I didn't bargain
for you and Hermione getting mixed up with her.'</p>

<p>'I don't see that we're either of us&mdash;&mdash; But Miss Levering
seems to go everywhere. Why shouldn't she?'</p>

<p>With sudden emphasis, 'You mustn't ask her to Eaton Square,'
said Aunt Lydia.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>'I have.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Heriot half rose from her seat. 'Then you'll have to
get out of it!'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'I am sure your grandfather would agree with me. I warn
you I won't stand by and see that woman getting you into her
clutches.'</p>

<p>'Clutches? Why should you think she wants me in her clutches?'</p>

<p>'Just for the pleasure of clutching! She's the kind that's
never satisfied till she has everybody in the pitiful state your
Aunt Ellen's in about her. Richard Farnborough, too, just on
the very verge of asking Hermione to marry him!'</p>

<p>'Oh, is that it?' the girl smiled wisely.</p>

<p>'No!' Too late Mrs. Heriot saw her misstep. 'That's <i>not</i>
it! And I am sure, if Mr. Stonor knew what I do, he would agree
with me that you must not ask her to the house.'</p>

<p>'Of course I'd do anything he asked me to. But he would give
me a reason. And a very good reason, too!' The pretty face was
very stubborn.</p>

<p>Aunt Lydia's wore the inflamed look not so much of one who is
angry as of a person who has a cold in the head.</p>

<p>'I'll give you the reason!' she said. 'It's not a thing I should
have preferred to tell you, but I know how difficult you are to
guide&mdash;so I suppose you'll have to know.' She looked round and lowered
her voice. 'It was ten or twelve years ago. I found her
horribly ill in a lonely Welsh farmhouse.'</p>

<p>'Miss Levering?'</p>

<p>Mrs. Heriot nodded. 'We had taken the Manor for that August.
The farmer's wife was frightened, and begged me to go and
see what I thought. I soon saw how it was&mdash;I thought she was
dying.'</p>

<p>'<i>Dying?</i> What was the&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I got no more out of her than the farmer's wife did. She had
no letters. There had been no one to see her except a man down
from London, a shady-looking doctor&mdash;nameless, of course.
And then this result. The farmer and his wife, highly respectable
people, were incensed. They were for turning the girl out.'</p>

<p>'<i>Oh</i>! but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes. Pitiless some of these people are! Although she had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>forfeited all claim&mdash;still she was a daughter of Sir Hervey Levering.
I insisted they should treat the girl humanely, and we became
friends&mdash;that is, "sort of." In spite of all I did for her&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What did you do?'</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I've told you, and I lent her money. No small sum
either&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Has she never paid it back?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes; after a time. But I <i>always</i> kept her secret&mdash;as
much as I knew.'</p>

<p>'But you've been telling me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That was my duty&mdash;and I never had her full confidence.'</p>

<p>'Wasn't it natural she&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well, all things considered, she might have wanted to tell me
who was responsible.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Aunt Lydia.'</p>

<p>'All she ever said was that she was ashamed'&mdash;Mrs. Heriot
was fast losing her temper and her fine feeling for the innocence of
her auditor&mdash;'ashamed that she "hadn't had the courage to resist"&mdash;not
the original temptation, but the pressure brought to
bear on her "not to go through with it," as she said.'</p>

<p>With a shrinking look the girl wrinkled her brows. 'You are
being so delicate&mdash;I'm not sure I understand.'</p>

<p>'The only thing you need understand,' said her aunt, irritably,
'is that she's not a desirable companion for a young girl.'</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>'When did you see her after&mdash;after&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Mrs. Heriot made a slight grimace. 'I met her last winter at&mdash;of
all places&mdash;the Bishop's!'</p>

<p>'They're relations of hers.'</p>

<p>'Yes. It was while you were in Scotland. They'd got her to
help with some of their work. Now she's taken hold of ours.
Your aunt and uncle are quite foolish about her, and I'm debarred
from taking any steps, at least till the Shelter is out of hand.'</p>

<p>The girl's face was shadowed&mdash;even a little frightened. It was
evident she was struggling not to give way altogether to alarm
and repulsion.</p>

<p>'I do rather wonder that after that, she can bring herself to talk
about&mdash;the unfortunate women of the world.'</p>

<p>'The effrontery of it!' said her aunt.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>'Or&mdash;the courage!' The girl put her hand up to her throat
as if the sentence had caught there.</p>

<p>'Even presumes to set <i>me</i> right! Of course I don't <i>mind</i> in the
least, poor soul&mdash;but I feel I owe it to your dead mother to tell
you about her, especially as you're old enough now to know something
about life.'</p>

<p>'And since a girl needn't be very old to suffer for her ignorance'&mdash;she
spoke slowly, moving a little away. But she stopped on the
final sentence: 'I <i>felt</i> she was rather wonderful!'</p>

<p>'<i>Wonderful!</i>'</p>

<p>'To have lived through <i>that</i>, when she was&mdash;how old?'</p>

<p>Mrs. Heriot rose with an increased irritation. 'Nineteen or
thereabouts.'</p>

<p>'Five years younger than I!' Jean sat down on the divan and
stared at the floor. 'To be abandoned, and to come out of it like
this!'</p>

<p>Mrs. Heriot went to her and laid her hand on the girl's shoulder.</p>

<p>'It was too bad to have to tell you such a sordid story to-day of
all days.'</p>

<p>'It is a terrible story, but this wasn't a bad time. I feel very
sorry to-day for women who aren't happy.' She started as a
motor-horn was faintly heard. 'That's Geoffrey!' She jumped
to her feet.</p>

<p>'Mr. Stonor. What makes you think&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes. I'm sure. I'm sure!' Every shadow fled out of
her face in the sudden burst of sunshine.</p>

<p>Lord John hurried in from the garden as the motor-horn sounded
louder.</p>

<p>'Who do you think is coming round the drive?'</p>

<p>Jean caught hold of him. 'Oh, dear! are those other people
all about? How am I ever going to be able to behave like a girl
who&mdash;who isn't engaged to the only man in the world worth
marrying!'</p>

<p>'You were expecting Mr. Stonor all the time!' exclaimed Aunt
Lydia.</p>

<p>'He promised he'd come to luncheon if it was humanly possible.
I was afraid to tell you for fear he'd be prevented.'</p>

<p>Lord John was laughing as he went towards the lobby. 'You
felt we couldn't have borne the disappointment!'</p>

<p>'I felt I couldn't,' said the girl, standing there with a rapt look.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p>She did not look round when Dick Farnborough ran in from
the garden, saying: '<i>Is</i> it&mdash;is it really?' For just then on the
opposite side of the great hall, the centre of a little buzz of welcome,
Stonor's tall figure appeared between host and hostess.</p>

<p>'What luck!' Farnborough said under his breath.</p>

<p>He hurried back and faced the rest of the party who were clustered
outside the window trying to look unconcerned.</p>

<p>'Yes, by Jove!' he set their incredulity at rest. 'It <i>is</i>!'</p>

<p>Discreetly they glanced and craned and then elaborately turned
their backs, pretending to be talking among themselves. But, as
though the girl standing there expectant in the middle of the hall
were well aware of the enormous sensation the new arrival had
created, she herself contributed nothing to it. Stonor came forward,
and she met him with a soft, happy look, and the low words:
'What a good thing you managed it!' Then she made way for
Mrs. Heriot's far more impressive greeting, innocent of the smallest
reminder of the last encounter!</p>

<p>It was Lord John who cut these amenities short by chaffing
Stonor for being so enterprising all of a sudden. 'Fancy your
motoring out of town to see a supporter on Sunday!'</p>

<p>'I don't know how we ever covered the ground in the old days,'
he answered. 'It's no use to stand for your borough any more.
The American, you know, he "runs" for Congress. By-and-by
we shall all be flying after the thing we want.' He smiled at Jean.</p>

<p>'Sh!' She glanced over her shoulder and spoke low. 'All sorts
of irrelevant people here.'</p>

<p>One of them, unable any longer to resist the temptation, was
making a second foray into the hall.</p>

<p>'How do you do, Mr. Stonor?' Farnborough stood there holding
out his hand.</p>

<p>The great man seemed not to see it, but he murmured, 'How
do you do?' and proceeded to share with Lady John his dislike
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>of any means of locomotion except his own legs or those of a horse.</p>

<p>It took a great deal to disconcert Farnborough. 'Some of us
were arguing in the smoking-room last night,' he said, 'whether
it didn't hurt a candidate's chances going about in a motor.'</p>

<p>As Mr. Stonor, not deigning to reply to this, paused the merest
instant in what he was saying to his hostess, Lord John came to the
rescue of the audacious young gentleman.</p>

<p>'Yes, we've been hearing a great many stories about the unpopularity
of motor-cars&mdash;among the class that hasn't got 'em, of
course.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure,' Lady John put in, 'you gain more votes by being able
to reach so many more of your constituents than we used&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know,' said Stonor. 'I've sometimes wondered
whether the charm of our presence wasn't counterbalanced by the
way we tear about smothering our fellow-beings in dust and running
down their pigs and chickens,&mdash;not to speak of their children.'</p>

<p>'What on the whole are the prospects?' Lord John asked.</p>

<p>'We shall have to work harder than we realized,' Stonor
answered gravely.</p>

<p>Farnborough let slip an 'Ah, I said so!' meant for Lady John,
and then before Stonor's raised eyes, the over-zealous young politician
retreated towards the window&mdash;but with hands in his
pockets and head held high, like one who has made his mark.
And so in truth he had. For Lady John let drop one or two good-natured
phrases&mdash;what he had done, his hero-worship, his mother
had been a Betham&mdash;Yes, he was one of the Farnboroughs of
Moore Abbey. Though Stonor made no comment beyond a dry,
'The staple product of this country, young men like that!'&mdash;it
appeared later that Lady John's good offices in favour of a probable
nephew-in-law had not been invoked in vain.</p>

<p>Despite the menace of 'the irrelevant' dotting the lawn immediately
outside the windows, the little group on the farther side of
the hall still stood there talking in low tones with the sense of intimacy
which belongs to a family party.</p>

<p>Jean had slipped her arm in her uncle's, and was smiling at
Stonor&mdash;</p>

<p>'He says he believes I'll be able to make a real difference to his
chances,' she said, half aside. 'Isn't it angelic of him?'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>'Angelic?' laughed the great man. 'Macchiavellian. I pin
all my hopes on your being able to counteract the pernicious influence
of my opponent's glib wife.'</p>

<p>'You want me to have a real share in it all, don't you, Geoffrey?'</p>

<p>'Of course I do.' He smiled into her eyes.</p>

<p>That moth Farnborough, whirling in the political effulgence,
was again hovering on the outskirts. He even made conversation
to Mrs. Heriot, as an excuse to remain inside the window.</p>

<p>'But you don't mean seriously,' Lord John asked his guest,
'you don't mean, do you, that there's any possible complication
about <i>your</i> seat?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I dare say it's all right'&mdash;Stonor drew a Sunday paper out
of his pocket. 'There's this agitation about the Woman Question.
Oddly enough, it seems as if it might&mdash;there's just the off-chance&mdash;it
<i>might</i> affect the issue.'</p>

<p>'Affect it? How? God bless my soul!' Lord John's transparent
skin flushed up to his white hair. 'Don't tell me any responsible
person is going even to consider the lunacy of tampering
with the British Constitution&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We <i>have</i> heard that suggested, though for better reasons,'
Stonor laughed, but not Lord John.</p>

<p>'Turn over the destinies of the Empire,' he said hotly, 'to a lot
of ignorant women just because a few of 'em have odious manners
and violent tongues!' The sight of Stonor's cool impassivity
calmed him somewhat. He went on more temperately. 'Every
sane person sees that the only trouble with England to-day is that
too many ignorant people have votes already.'</p>

<p>'The penalty we pay for being more republican than the Republics.'</p>

<p>Lord John had picked up the Sunday paper and glanced down
a column.</p>

<p>'If the worst came to the worst, you can do what the other
four hundred have done.'</p>

<p>'Easily! But the mere fact that four hundred and twenty
members have been worried into promising support&mdash;and then,
once in the House, have let the matter severely alone&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Let it alone?' Lord John burst out again. 'I should think so
indeed!'</p>

<p>'Yes,' laughed Stonor, 'only it's a device that's somewhat worn.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>'Still,' Lord John put on a Macchiavellian air that sat rather
incongruously on his honest English face, 'Still, if they think they're
getting a future Cabinet Minister on their side&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It will be sufficiently embarrassing for the Cabinet Minister.'</p>

<p>Stonor caught sight of Farnborough approaching and lowered
his voice. He leaned his elbow on the end of the wide mantelpiece
and gave his attention exclusively to Lord John, seeming to ignore
even the pretty girl who still stood by her uncle with a hand slipped
through his arm.</p>

<p>'Nobody says much about it,' Stonor went on, 'but it's realized
that the last Labour member, and that Colne Valley Socialist&mdash;those
men got in largely through the tireless activity of the women.'</p>

<p>'The Suffragettes!' exclaimed the girl, '<i>they</i> were able to do that?'</p>

<p>'They're always saying they don't favour <i>any</i> party,' said a
voice.</p>

<p>Stonor looked up, and, to Jean's obvious relief, refrained from
snubbing the irrepressible Farnborough.</p>

<p>'I don't know what they <i>say</i>&mdash;&mdash;' began Stonor.</p>

<p>'Oh, <i>I</i> do!' Farnborough interrupted. 'They're not <i>for</i>
anybody. They're simply agin the Government.'</p>

<p>'Whatever they say, they're all Socialists.' Lord John gave
a snort.</p>

<p>'No,' said Farnborough, with cool audacity. 'It only looks
like that.'</p>

<p>Jean turned quite pink with anxiety. She, and all who knew
him well, had seen Stonor crush the cocksure and the unwary
with an awful effectualness. But Farnborough, with the courage
of enthusiasm&mdash;enthusiasm for himself and his own future&mdash;went
stoutly on.</p>

<p>'There are Liberals and even Unionists among 'em. And they
do manage to hold the balance pretty even. I go and hear them,
you see!'</p>

<p>'And speaking from the height of your advantage,' although
Stonor was slightly satirical, he was exercising an exceptional forbearance,
'do you mean to tell me they are not more in sympathy
with the Labour party than with any other?'</p>

<p>'If they are, it's not because the Suffragists are all for Socialism.
But because the Labour party is the only one that puts Women's
Suffrage in the forefront of its programme.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Stonor took his elbow off the mantel. 'Whatever the reason,'
he said airily, 'the result is momentarily inconvenient. Though
I am one of those who think it would be easy to overestimate the
importance&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He broke off with an effect of dismissing both the matter and
the man. As he turned away, he found himself without the smallest
warning face to face with Vida Levering. She had come down
the great staircase unobserved and unobserving; her head bent,
and she in the act of forcing a recalcitrant hatpin through her hat&mdash;doing
it under certain disadvantages, as she held her gloves
and her veil in one hand.</p>

<p>As she paused there, confronting the tall figure of the new-comer,
although it was obvious that her unpreparedness was not less than
his own, there was to the most acute eye nothing in the remotest
degree dramatic about the encounter&mdash;hardly more than a cool
surprise, and yet there was that which made Jean say, smiling&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, you know one another already?'</p>

<p>'Everybody in this part of the world knows Mr. Stonor,' the
lady said, 'but he doesn't know me.'</p>

<p>'This is Miss Levering. You knew her father, didn't you?'</p>

<p>Even before Lady John had introduced them, the people in the
garden seemed not to be able to support the prospect of Miss
Levering's threatened monopoly of the lion. They swarmed in&mdash;Hermione
Heriot and Paul Filey appearing for the first time since
church&mdash;they overflowed into the Hall, while Jean Dunbarton,
with artless enthusiasm, was demanding of Miss Levering if the
reason she knew Mr. Stonor was that she had been hearing him
speak.</p>

<p>'Yes,' the lady met his eyes, 'I was visiting some relations near
Dutfield. They took me to hear you.'</p>

<p>'Oh&mdash;the night the Suffragettes made their customary row&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'They didn't attack <i>you</i>,' she reminded him.</p>

<p>'They will if we win the election!' he said, with a cynical anticipation.</p>

<p>It was a mark of how far the Women's Cause had travelled that,
although there was no man there (except the ineffectual Farnborough)&mdash;no
one to speak of it even with tolerance, there was
also no one, not even Greatorex, who any longer felt the matter
to be much of a joke. Here again in this gathering was happening
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>what the unprejudiced observer was seeing in similar circumstances
all over England. The mere mention of Women's Suffrage in
general society (rarest of happenings now)&mdash;that topic which
had been the prolific mother of so much merriment, bred in these
days but silence and constraint. The quickest-witted changed the
topic amid a general sense of grateful relief. The thing couldn't
be laughed at any longer, but it could still be pretended it wasn't
there.</p>

<p>'You've come just in time to rescue me!' Mrs. Freddy said,
sparkling at Stonor.</p>

<p>'You don't appear to be in any serious danger,' he said.</p>

<p>'But I am, or I <i>was</i>! They were just insisting I should go upstairs
and change my frock.'</p>

<p>'Is there anybody here so difficult as not to like that one?'</p>

<p>She made him a smart little curtsey. 'Although we're going to
have luncheon in less than an hour, somebody was going to insist
(out of pure mistaken philanthropy) in taking me for a walk. I've
told Freddy that when I've departed for realms of bliss, he is to put
on my tombstone, "Died of changing her clothes." I know the
end will come some Sunday. We appear at breakfast dressed for
church. That's a long skirt. We are usually shooed upstairs
directly we get back, to put on a short one, so that we can go and
look at the kennels or the prize bull. We come back muddy and
smelling of stables. We get into something fresh for luncheon.
After luncheon some one says, "Walk!" Another short skirt.
We come back draggled and dreadful. We change. Something
sweetly feminine for tea! The gong. We rush and dress for
dinner! You've saved me one change, anyhow. You are my
benefactor. Why don't you ask after my babies?'</p>

<p>'Well, how are the young barbarians?' He rubbed his hand
over the lower part of his face. 'Your concern for personal appearance
reminds me that a little soap and water after my dusty
drive&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Little as had fallen from him since his entrance, as he followed
Lord John upstairs, he left behind that sense of blankness so
curiously independent of either words or deeds. Greatorex, in
his patent leather shoes and immaculate white gaiters, pattered
over to Miss Levering, but she unkindly presented her back, and
sat down at the writing-table to make a note on the abhorred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Shelter plan. He showed his disapproval by marching off with
Mr. Freddy, and there was a general trickling back into the
garden in that aimless, before-luncheon mood.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Heriot and Lady John sat with their heads close together
on the sofa, discussing in undertones the absorbing subject
of the prospective new member of the family.</p>

<p>Mrs. Freddy perched on the edge of the writing-table between
Miss Levering, who sat in front of it, and Jean, whose chair was
on the other side. She was nearest Jean, but it was to her children's
sworn friend that she turned to say enthusiastically&mdash;</p>

<p>'Delightful his coming in like that!' And no one needed to be
told whose coming brought delight. 'We must tell Sara and Cecil.'</p>

<p>As Miss Levering seemed to be still absorbed in making notes
on that boring plan, the lively Mrs. Freddy turned to her other
neighbour.</p>

<p>'Penny for your thoughts,' she demanded with such suddenness
that Jean Dunbarton started and reddened. 'Something very
weighty, to judge from&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I believe I was thinking it was rather odd to hear two men
like my uncle and Mr. Stonor talking about the influence of the
Suffrage women really quite seriously. <i>Oh!</i>'&mdash;she clutched Mrs.
Freddy's arm, laughing apologetically&mdash;'I beg your pardon.
I forgot. Besides, I wasn't thinking of your kind; I was thinking
of the Suffragettes.'</p>

<p>'As the only conceivable ones to be exercising any influence.
Thank you.'</p>

<p>'Oh, no, no. Indeed, I didn't mean&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, you did. You're like the rest. You don't realize how
we prepared the ground. All the same,' she went on, with her
unfailing good humour, 'it's frightfully exciting seeing the Question
come into practical politics at last. I only hope those women
won't go and upset the apple-cart again.'</p>

<p>'How?'</p>

<p>'Oh, by doing something that will alienate all our good friends
in both parties. It's queer they can't see our only chance to get
what we want is by winning over the men.'</p>

<p>There was a low sound of impatience from the person at the
writing-table, and a rustle of paper as the plan was thrown down.</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' said Mrs. Freddy.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>'"Winning over the men" has been the woman's way since the
Creation. Do you think the result should make us proud of our
policy? Yes? Then go and walk in Piccadilly at midnight.'</p>

<p>Lady John and Mrs. Heriot rose as one, while Miss Levering
was adding&mdash;</p>

<p>'No, I forgot&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes,' interposed Mrs. Heriot, with majesty, 'it is not the first
time you've forgotten.'</p>

<p>'What I forgot was the magistrate's ruling. He said no decent
woman had any business to be in London's main thoroughfares at
night "<i>unless she has a man with her</i>." You can hear that in
Soho, too. "You're obliged to take up with a chap!" is what the
women say.'</p>

<p>In a highly significant silence, Mrs. Heriot withdrew with her
niece and Mrs. Freddy to where Hermione sat contentedly between
two young men on the window-step. Lady John, naturally
somewhat ruffled, but still quite kind, bent over her indiscreet
guest to say&mdash;</p>

<p>'What an odd mood you are in to-day, my dear. I think Lydia
Heriot's right. We oughtn't to do anything, or <i>say</i> anything to
encourage this ferment of feminism&mdash;and I'll tell you why:
it's likely to bring a very terrible thing in its train.'</p>

<p>'What terrible thing?'</p>

<p>'Sex-Antagonism.'</p>

<p>'It's here.'</p>

<p>'Don't say that!' Lady John spoke very gravely.</p>

<p>'You're so conscious it's here, you're afraid to have it mentioned.'</p>

<p>Lady John perceived that Jean had quietly slipped away from
the others, and was standing behind her.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Heriot had not been too absorbed in Dick Farnborough
and Hermione she would have had a moment's pleasure in her
handiwork&mdash;that half-shamed scrutiny in Jean Dunbarton's
face. But as the young girl studied the quiet figure, looked into
the tender eyes that gazed so steadily into some grey country far
away, the effect of Mrs. Heriot's revelation was either weakened
or transmuted subtly to something stronger than the thing that it
replaced.</p>

<p>As the woman sat there leaning her head a little wearily on her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>hand, there was about the whole <i>Wesen</i> an indefinable nobility
that answered questions before they were asked.</p>

<p>But Lady John, upon perceiving her niece, had said hurriedly&mdash;</p>

<p>'If what you say is so, it's the fault of those women agitators.'</p>

<p>'Sex-Antagonism wasn't their invention,' Miss Levering answered.
'No woman begins that way. Every woman is in a
state of natural subjection'&mdash;she looked up, and seeing Jean's
face, smiled&mdash;'no, I'd rather say "allegiance" to her idea of romance
and her hope of motherhood; they're embodied for her
in man. They're the strongest things in life till man kills them.
Let's be fair. If that allegiance dies, each woman knows why.'</p>

<p>Lady John, always keenly alive to any change in the social atmosphere,
looked up and saw her husband coming downstairs
with their guest. As she went to meet them, Stonor stopped halfway
down to say something. The two men halted there deep in
discussion. But scarcely deeper than those other two Lady
John had left by the writing-table.</p>

<p>'Who is it you are going to marry?' Miss Levering had
asked.</p>

<p>'It isn't going to be announced for a few days yet.' And then
Jean relented enough to say in an undertone, almost confidentially,
'I should think you'd guess.'</p>

<p>'Guess what?' said the other, absent-mindedly, but again
lifting her eyes.</p>

<p>'Who I'm going to marry.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I know him, then?' she said, surprised.</p>

<p>'Well, you've seen him.'</p>

<p>Miss Levering shook her head. 'There are so very many
young men in the world.' But she looked with a moment's wondering
towards the window, seeming to consider first Filey and then
Farnborough.</p>

<p>'What made you think of going on that terrible pilgrimage?'
asked the girl.</p>

<p>'Something I heard at a Suffrage meeting.'</p>

<p>'Well, do you know, ever since that Sunday at the Freddys',
when you told us about the Suffragettes, I&mdash;I've been curious
about them.'</p>

<p>'You said nothing would ever induce you to listen to such
people.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>'I know, and it's rather silly, but one says a thing like that on
the spur of the moment, and then one is bound by it.'</p>

<p>'You mean one imagines one is bound.'</p>

<p>'Then, too, I've been in Scotland ever since; but I've often
thought about you and what you said that day at the Freddys'!'</p>

<p>'And yet you've been a good deal absorbed&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You see,' the girl put on a pretty little air of superiority, 'it
isn't as if the man I'm going to marry wasn't very broad-minded.
He wants me to be intelligent about politics. Are those women
holding meetings in London now as well as in the constituencies?'</p>

<p>They both became aware at the same moment that Lord John
was coming slowly down the last steps, with Stonor still more
slowly following, talking Land Tenure. As Miss Levering rose
and hurriedly turned over the things on the table to look for her
veil, the handkerchief she had shut in her little Italian book dropped
out. A further shifting of plans and papers sent it unobserved to
the floor. Jean put once more the question that had remained
unanswered.</p>

<p>'They collect too great crowds,' Miss Levering answered her.
'The authorities won't let them meet in Trafalgar Square after
to-day. They have their last meeting there at three o'clock.'</p>

<p>'To-day! That's no use to people out of town&mdash;unless I
could invent some excuse&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Wait till you can go without inventions and excuses.'</p>

<p>'You think all that wrong!'</p>

<p>'I think it rather undignified.'</p>

<p>'So do I&mdash;but if I'm ever to go&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Lord John came forward, leaving Stonor to his hostess. 'Still
talking over your Shelter plan?' he asked benevolently.</p>

<p>'No,' answered Miss Levering, 'we left the Shelter some time ago.'</p>

<p>He pinched his niece's ear with affectionate playfulness.</p>

<p>'Then what's all this chatterment about?'</p>

<p>The girl, a little confused, looked at her fellow-conspirator.</p>

<p>'The latest things in veils,' said Miss Levering, smiling, as she
caught up hers.</p>

<p>'The invincible frivolity of women!' said Lord John, with
immense geniality.</p>

<p>'Oh, they're coming for you,' Jean said. 'Don't forget your
book. When shall I see you again, I wonder?'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>But instead of announcing the carriage the servant held out a
salver. On it lay a telegraph form scribbled over in pencil.</p>

<p>'A telephone message, miss.'</p>

<p>'For me?' said Jean, in surprise.</p>

<p>'Yes, miss. I didn't know you was here, miss. They asked
me to write it down, and let you have it as soon as possible.'</p>

<p>'I knew how it would be if I gave in about that telephone!'
Lord John arraigned his wife. Even Mr. Stonor had to sympathize.
'They won't leave people in peace even one day in the
week.'</p>

<p>'I've got your book,' Jean said, looking at Miss Levering over
the top of the telegraph form, and then glancing at the title as she
restored the volume to its owner. 'Dante! Whereabouts are you?'
She opened it without waiting to hear. 'Oh, the Inferno.'</p>

<p>'No, I'm in a worse place,' said the other, smiling vaguely as
she drew on her gloves.</p>

<p>'I didn't know there was a worse.'</p>

<p>'Yes, it's worse with the Vigliacchi.'</p>

<p>'I forget, were they Guelf or Ghibelline?'</p>

<p>'They weren't either, and that was why Dante couldn't stand
them. He said there was no place in Heaven nor in Purgatory&mdash;not
even a corner in Hell, for the souls who had stood aloof from
strife.' The smile faded as she stood there looking steadily into
the girl's eyes. 'He called them "wretches who never lived,"
Dante did, because they'd never felt the pangs of partisanship.
And so they wander homeless on the skirts of limbo, among the
abortions and off-scourings of Creation.'</p>

<p>The girl drew a fluttering breath. Miss Levering glanced at
the clock, and turned away to make her leisurely adieux among the
group at the window.</p>

<p>Mrs. Heriot left it at once. 'What was that about a telephone
message, Jean darling?'</p>

<p>The girl glanced at the paper, and then quite suddenly said to
Lady John&mdash;</p>

<p>'Aunt Ellen, I've got to go to London!'</p>

<p>'Not to-day!'</p>

<p>'My dear child!'</p>

<p>'Nonsense!'</p>

<p>'Is your grandfather worse?'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>'N&mdash;no. I don't think my grandfather is any worse. But I
must go, all the same.'</p>

<p>'You <i>can't</i> go away,' whispered Mrs. Heriot, 'when Mr.
Stonor&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Back me up!' Jean whispered to Lady John. 'He said he'd
have to leave directly after luncheon. And anyhow&mdash;all these
people&mdash;please have us another time.'</p>

<p>'I'll just see Miss Levering off,' said Lady John, 'and then I'll
come back and talk about it.'</p>

<p>In the midst of the good-byeing that was going on over by the
window, Jean suddenly exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'There mayn't be another train! Miss Levering!'</p>

<p>But Stonor was standing in front of the girl barring the way.
'What if there isn't? I'll take you back in my motor,' he said
aside.</p>

<p>'<i>Will</i> you?' In her rapture at the thought Jean clasped her
hands, and the paper fluttered to the floor. 'But I must be there
by three,' she said.</p>

<p>He had picked up the telegraph form as well as the handkerchief
lying near.</p>

<p>'Why, it's only an invitation to dine&mdash;Wednesday!'</p>

<p>'Sh!' She took the paper.</p>

<p>'Oh! I see!' He smiled and lowered his voice. 'It's rather
dear of you to arrange our going off like that. You <i>are</i> a clever
little girl!'</p>

<p>'It's not exactly that I was arranging. I want to hear those
women in Trafalgar Square&mdash;the Suffragettes.'</p>

<p>He stared at her more than half incredulous, but smiling
still.</p>

<p>'How perfectly absurd! Besides,'&mdash;he looked across the room
at Lady John&mdash;'besides, I expect she wouldn't like my carrying
you off like that.'</p>

<p>'Then she'll have to make an excuse, and come too.'</p>

<p>'Ah, it wouldn't be quite the same if she did that.'</p>

<p>But Jean had thought it out. 'Aunt Ellen and I could get back
quite well in time for dinner.'</p>

<p>The group that had closed about the departing guest dissolved.</p>

<p>'Why are you saying good-bye as if you were never coming
back?' Lord John demanded.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>'One never knows,' Miss Levering laughed. 'Maybe I shan't
come back.'</p>

<p>'Don't talk as if you meant never!' said Mrs. Freddy.</p>

<p>'Perhaps I do mean never.' She nodded to Stonor.</p>

<p>He bowed ceremoniously.</p>

<p>'Never come back! What nonsense are you talking?' said
Lady John.</p>

<p>'Is it premonition of death, or don't you like us any more?'
laughed her husband.</p>

<p>The little group trailed across the great room, escorting the guest
to the front door, Lady John leading the way. As they passed,
Geoffrey Stonor was obviously not listening very attentively to
Jean's enthusiastic explanation of her plan for the afternoon. He
kept his eyes lowered. They rested on the handkerchief he had
picked up, but hardly as if, after all, they saw it, though he turned
the filmy square from corner to corner with an air partly of nervousness,
partly of abstraction.</p>

<p>'Is it mine?' asked Jean.</p>

<p>He paused an instant. 'No. Yours,' he said, mechanically,
and held out the handkerchief to Miss Levering.</p>

<p>She seemed not to hear. Lord John had blocked the door a
moment, insisting on a date for the next visit. Jean caught up
the handkerchief and went running forward with it. Suddenly
she stopped, glancing down at the embroidered corner.</p>

<p>'But that's not an L! It's V&mdash;i&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Stonor turned his back, and took up a magazine.</p>

<p>Lady John's voice sounded clear from the lobby. 'You must
let Vida go, John, or she'll miss her train.'</p>

<p>Miss Levering vanished.</p>

<p>'I didn't know her name was Vida; how did you?' said Jean.</p>

<p>Stonor bent his head silently over the book. Perhaps he hadn't
heard. That deafening old gong was sounding for luncheon.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p>The last of the Trafalgar Square meetings was half over when
the great chocolate-coloured motor, containing three persons besides
the chauffeur, slowed up on the west side of the square. Neither
of the two ladies in their all-enveloping veils was easily recognizable,
still less the be-goggled countenance of the Hon. Geoffrey
Stonor. When he took off his motor glasses, he did not turn down
his dust collar. He even pulled farther over his eyes the peak of
his linen cap.</p>

<p>By coming at all on this expedition, he had given Jean a signal
proof of his desire to please her&mdash;but it was plain that he had no
mind to see in the papers that he had been assisting at such a
spectacle. While he gave instructions as to where the car should
wait, Jean was staring at the vast crowd massed on the north side
of the column. It extended back among the fountains, and even
escaped on each side beyond the vigilance of the guardian lions.
There were scores listening there who could not see the speakers
even as well as could the occupants of the car. In front of the
little row of women on the plinth a gaunt figure in brown serge
was waving her arms. What she was saying was blurred in the
general uproar.</p>

<p>'Oh, that's one!' Jean called out excitedly. 'Oh, let's hurry.'</p>

<p>But even after they left the car and reached the crowd, to hurry
was a thing no man could do. For some minutes the motor-party
had only occasional glimpses of the speakers, and heard little more
than fragments.</p>

<p>'Who is that, Geoffrey?'</p>

<p>'The tall young fellow with the stoop? That appears to be the
chairman.' Stonor himself stooped&mdash;to the eager girl who had
clutched his sleeve from behind, and was following him closely
through the press. 'The artless chairman, I take it, is scolding
the people for not giving the woman a hearing!' They laughed
together at the young man's foolishness.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Even had an open-air meeting been more of a commonplace to
Stonor, it would have had for him that effect of newness that an old
thing wears when seen by an act of sympathy through new eyes.</p>

<p>'You must be sure and explain <i>everything</i> to me, Geoffrey,' said
the girl. 'This is to be an important chapter in my education.'
Merrily and without a shadow of misgiving she spoke in jest a
truer word than she dreamed. He fell in with her mood.</p>

<p>'Well, I rather gather that he's been criticizing the late Government,
and Liberals have made it hot for him.'</p>

<p>'I shall never be able to hear unless we get nearer,' said Jean,
anxiously.</p>

<p>'There's a very rough element in front there&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, don't let us mind!'</p>

<p>'Most certainly I mind!'</p>

<p>'Oh, but I should be miserable if I didn't hear.'</p>

<p>She pleaded so bewitchingly for a front seat at the Show that
unwillingly he wormed his way on. Suddenly he stood still and
stared about.</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' said Lady John.</p>

<p>'I can't have you ladies pushed about in this crowd,' he said
under his breath. 'I must get hold of a policeman. You wait
just here. I'll find one.'</p>

<p>The adoring eyes of the girl watched the tall figure disappear.</p>

<p>'Look at her face!' Lady John, with her eyeglass up, was
staring in the opposite direction. 'She's like an inspired charwoman!'</p>

<p>Jean turned, and in her eagerness pressed on, Lady John following.</p>

<p>The agreeable presence of the young chairman was withdrawn
from the fighting-line, and the figure of the working-woman stood
alone. With her lean brown finger pointing straight at the more
outrageous of the young hooligans, and her voice raised shrill
above their impertinence&mdash;</p>

<p>'I've got boys of me own,' she said, 'and we laugh at all sorts o'
things, but I should be ashymed, and so would they, if ever they
wus to be'yve as you're doin' to-d'y.'</p>

<p>When they had duly hooted that sentiment, they were quieter
for a moment.</p>

<p>'People 'ave been sayin' this is a Middle-Class Woman's Move<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>ment.
It's a libel. I'm a workin' woman m'self, the wife of a
workin' man&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Pore devil!'</p>

<p>'Don't envy 'im, m'self!'</p>

<p>As one giving her credentials, she went on, 'I'm a Pore Law
Guardian&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Think o' that, now! Gracious me!'</p>

<p>A friendly person in the crowd turned upon the scoffer.</p>

<p>'Shut up, cawn't yer.'</p>

<p>'Not fur you!</p>

<p>Further statements on the part of the orator were drowned by&mdash;</p>

<p>'Go 'ome and darn your ol' man's stockin's.'</p>

<p>'Just clean yer <i>own</i> doorstep.'</p>

<p>She glowered her contempt upon the interrupters.' It's a pore
sort of 'ousekeeper that leaves 'er doorstep till Sunday afternoon.
Maybe that's when you would do your doorstep. I do mine in
the mornin', before you men are awake!' They relished that
and gave her credit for a bull's eye.</p>

<p>'You think,' she went on quietly, seeing she had 'got them'&mdash;'you
think we women 'ave no business servin' on Boards and thinking
about politics.' In a tone of exquisite contempt, 'But wot's
politics!' she demanded. 'It's just 'ousekeepin' on a big scyle.'
Somebody applauded. 'Oo among you workin' men 'as the most
comfortable 'omes? Those of you that gives yer wives yer wyges.'</p>

<p>'That's it! That's it!' they roared with passion.</p>

<p>'Wantin' our money.'</p>

<p>'That's all this agitation's about.'</p>

<p>'Listen to me!' She came close to the edge of the plinth. 'If
it wus only to use fur <i>our</i> comfort, d'ye think many o' you workin'
men would be found turnin' over their wyges to their wives? No!
Wot's the reason thousands do&mdash;and the best and the soberest?
Because the workin' man knows that wot's a pound to <i>'im</i> is twenty
shillins to 'is wife, and she'll myke every penny in every one o'
them shillins <i>tell</i>. She gets more fur 'im out of 'is wyges than wot
'e can. Some o' you know wot the 'omes is like w'ere the men
<i>don't</i> let the women manage. Well, the Poor Laws and the 'ole
Government is just in the syme muddle because the men 'ave tried
to do the national 'ousekeepin' without the women!'</p>

<p>They hooted, but they listened, too.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>'Like I said to you before, it's a libel to say it's only the well-off
women wot's wantin' the vote. I can tell you wot plenty o' the
poor women think about it. I'm one o' them! And I can tell
you we see there's reforms needed. <i>We ought to 'ave the vote</i>;
and we know 'ow to appreciate the other women 'oo go to prison
for tryin' to get it for us!'</p>

<p>With a little final bob of emphasis, and a glance over her shoulder
at the old woman and the young one behind her, she was about to
retire. But she paused as the murmur in the crowd grew into
distinct phrases.</p>

<p>'&rsquo;Inderin' policemen!'&mdash;'Mykin' rows in the street;' and a
voice called out so near Jean that the girl jumped, 'It's the w'y
yer goes on as mykes 'em keep ye from gettin' votes. They see
ye ain't fit to 'ave&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>And then all the varied charges were swallowed in a general
uproar.</p>

<p>'Where's Geoffrey? Oh, <i>isn't</i> she too funny for words?'</p>

<p>The agitated chairman had come forward. 'You evidently
don't know,' he said, 'what had to be done by <i>men</i> before the extension
of suffrage in '67. If it hadn't been for demonstrations&mdash;&mdash;'
But the rest was drowned.</p>

<p>The brown-serge woman stood there waiting, wavering a moment;
and suddenly her shrill note rose clear over the indistinguishable
Babel.</p>

<p>'You s'y woman's plyce is 'ome! Don't you know there's a
third of the women in this country can't afford the luxury of stayin'
in their 'omes? They <i>got</i> to go out and 'elp make money to p'y
the rent and keep the 'ome from bein' sold up. Then there's all
the women that 'aven't got even miserable 'omes. They 'aven't
got any 'omes <i>at all</i>.'</p>

<p>'You said <i>you</i> got one. W'y don't you stop in it?'</p>

<p>'Yes, that's like a man. If one o' you is all right he thinks the
rest don't matter. We women&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But they overwhelmed her. She stood there with her gaunt
arms folded&mdash;waiting. You felt that she had met other crises
of her life with just that same smouldering patience. When the
wave of noise subsided again, she was discovered to be speaking.</p>

<p>'P'raps <i>your</i> 'omes are all right! P'raps your children never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>goes 'ungry. P'raps you aren't livin', old and young, married and
single, in one room.'</p>

<p>'I suppose life is like that for a good many people,' Jean Dunbarton
turned round to say.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' said her aunt.</p>

<p>'I come from a plyce where many fam'lies, if they're to go on
livin' <i>at all</i>, 'ave to live like that. If you don't believe me, come
and let me show you!' She spread out her lean arms. 'Come
with me to Canning Town&mdash;come with me to Bromley&mdash;come
to Poplar and to Bow. No, you won't even think about the over-worked
women and the underfed children, and the 'ovels they live
in. And you want that <i>we</i> shouldn't think neither&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We'll do the thinkin'. You go 'ome and nuss the byby.'</p>

<p>'I do nurse my byby; I've nursed seven. What have you done
for yours?' She waited in vain for the answer. 'P'raps,' her
voice quivered, 'p'raps your children never goes 'ungry, and maybe
you're satisfied&mdash;though I must say I wouldn't a thought it from
the look o' yer.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I s'y!'</p>

<p>'But we women are not satisfied. We don't only want better
things for our own children; we want better things for all. <i>Every</i>
child is our child. We know in our 'earts we oughtn't to rest till
we've mothered 'em every one.'</p>

<p>'Wot about the men? Are <i>they</i> all 'appy?'</p>

<p>There was derisive laughter at that, and 'No! No!' 'Not
precisely!' '<i>'Appy?</i> Lord!'</p>

<p>'No, there's lots o' you men I'm sorry for,' she said.</p>

<p>'Thanks, awfully!'</p>

<p>'And we'll 'elp you if you let us,' she said.</p>

<p>'&rsquo;Elp us? You tyke the bread out of our mouths.'</p>

<p>'Now you're goin' to begin about us blackleggin' the men!
<i>W'y</i> does any woman tyke less wyges than a man for the same
work? Only because we can't get anything better. That's part
the reason w'y we're yere to-d'y. Do you reely think,' she reasoned
with them as man to man; 'do you think, now, we tyke
those low wyges because we got a likin' fur low wyges? No.
We're just like you. We want as much as ever we can get.'</p>

<p>'&rsquo;Ear! 'ear!'</p>

<p>'We got a gryte deal to do with our <a name="Page_248t" id="Page_248t"></a><a href="#Page_248tn">wyges</a>, we women has. We
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>got the children to think about. And w'en we get our rights, a
woman's flesh and blood won't be so much cheaper than a man's
that employers can get rich on keepin' you out o' work and sweatin'
us. If you men only could see it, we got the syme cause, and if you
'elped us you'd be 'elpin' yerselves.'</p>

<p>'Rot!'</p>

<p>'True as gospel!' some one said.</p>

<p>'Drivel!'</p>

<p>As she retired against the banner with the others, there was
some applause.</p>

<p>'Well, now,' said a man patronizingly, 'that wusn't so bad&mdash;fur
a woman.'</p>

<p>'N&mdash;naw. Not fur a woman.'</p>

<p>Jean had been standing on tip-toe making signals. Ah, at last
Geoffrey saw her! But why was he looking so grave?</p>

<p>'No policeman?' Lady John asked.</p>

<p>'Not on that side. They seem to have surrounded the storm
centre, which is just in front of the place you've rather unwisely
chosen.' Indeed it was possible to see, further on, half a dozen
helmets among the hats.</p>

<p>What was happening on the plinth seemed to have a lessened
interest for Jean Dunbarton. She kept glancing sideways up
under the cap brim at the eyes of the man at her side.</p>

<p>Lady John on the other hand was losing nothing. 'Is <i>she</i> one
of them? That little thing?'</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I suppose so,' answered Stonor, doubtfully, though the
chairman, with a cheerful air of relief, had introduced Miss
Ernestine Blunt to the accompaniment of cheers and a general
moving closer to the monument.</p>

<p>Lady John, after studying Ernestine an instant through her
glass, turned to a dingy person next her, who was smoking a short
pipe.</p>

<p>'Among those women up there,' said Lady John, 'can you tell
me, my man, which are the ones that a&mdash;that make the disturbances?'</p>

<p>The man removed his pipe and spat carefully between his feet.
Then with deliberation he said&mdash;</p>

<p>'The one that's doing the talking now&mdash;she's the disturbingest
o' the lot.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>'Not that nice little&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Don't you be took in, mum;' and he resumed the consolatory
pipe.</p>

<p>'What is it, Geoffrey? Have I done anything?' Jean said
very low.</p>

<p>'Why didn't you stay where I left you<a name="Page_250t" id="Page_250t"></a><a href="#Page_250tn">?'</a> he answered, without
looking at her.</p>

<p>'I couldn't hear. I couldn't even see. Please don't look like
that. Forgive me,' she pleaded, covertly seeking his hand.</p>

<p>His set face softened. 'It frightened me when I didn't see
you where I left you.'</p>

<p>She smiled, with recovered spirits. She could attend now to
the thing she had come to see.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry you missed the inspired charwoman. It's rather
upsetting to think&mdash;do you suppose any of our servants have&mdash;views?'</p>

<p>Stonor laughed. 'Oh, no! Our servants are all too superior.'
He moved forward and touched a policeman on the shoulder.
What was said was not audible&mdash;the policeman at first shook
his head, then suddenly he turned round, looked sharply into
the gentleman's face, and his whole manner changed. Obliging,
genial, almost obsequious. 'Oh, he's recognized Geoffrey!'
Jean said to her aunt. 'They <i>have</i> to do what a member tells
them! They'll stop the traffic any time to let Geoffrey go by!'
she exulted.</p>

<p>Stonor beckoned to his ladies. The policeman was forging
a way in which they followed.</p>

<p>'This will do,' Stonor said at last, and he whispered again to
the policeman. The man replied, grinning. 'Oh, really,' Stonor
smiled, too. 'This is the redoubtable Miss Ernestine Blunt,'
he explained over his shoulder, and he drew back so that Jean
could pass, and standing so, directly in front of him, she could be
protected right and left, if need were, by a barrier made of his arms.</p>

<p>'Now can you see?' he asked.</p>

<p>She looked round and nodded. Her face was without cloud
again. She leaned lightly against his arm.</p>

<p>Miss Ernestine had meanwhile been catapulting into election
issues with all the fervour of a hot-gospeller.</p>

<p>'What outrageous things she says about important people&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>people
she ought to respect and be rather afraid of,' objected
Jean, rather scandalized.</p>

<p>'Impudent little baggage!' said Stonor.</p>

<p>Reasons, a plenty, the baggage had why the Party which had
so recently refused to enfranchise women should not be returned
to power.</p>

<p>'You're in too big a hurry,' some one shouted. 'All the
Liberals want is a little time.'</p>

<p>'Time! You seem not to know that the first petition in favour
of giving us the Franchise was signed in 1866.'</p>

<p>'How do <i>you</i> know?'</p>

<p>She paused a moment, taken off her guard by the suddenness
of the attack.</p>

<p>'<i>You</i> wasn't there!'</p>

<p>'That was the trouble. Haw! Haw!'</p>

<p>'That petition,' she said, 'was presented forty years ago.'</p>

<p>'Give 'er a 'reain' now she <i>'as</i> got out of 'er crydle.'</p>

<p>'It was presented to the House of Commons by John Stuart
Mill. Give the Liberals time!' she echoed. 'Thirty-three
years ago memorials in favour of the suffrage were presented to
Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Disraeli. In 1896, 257,000 women of
these British Isles signed an appeal to the members of Parliament.
Bills or Resolutions have been before the House, on and
off, for the last thirty-six years. All that "time" thrown away!
At the opening of this year we found ourselves with no assurance
that if we went on in the same way, any girl born into the world
in our time would ever be able to exercise the rights of citizenship
though she lived to be a hundred. That was why we said
all this has been in vain. We must try some other way. How
did you working men get the suffrage, we asked ourselves. Well,
we turned up the records&mdash;and we <i>saw</i>. We don't want to follow
such a violent example. We would much rather not&mdash;but if
that's the only way we can make the country see we're in earnest&mdash;we
are prepared to show them!'</p>

<p>'An' they'll show <i>you</i>!'</p>

<p>'Give ye another month 'ard!'</p>

<p>In the midst of the laughter and interruptions, a dirty, beery
fellow of fifty or so, from whom Stonor's arm was shielding Jean,
turned to the pal behind him with&mdash;</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>'Ow'd yer like to be <i>that</i> one's 'usband? Think o' comin'
'ome to <i>that</i>!'</p>

<p>'I'd soon learn 'er!' answered the other, with a meaning look.</p>

<p>'Don't think that going to prison again has any fears for us.
We'd go for life if by doing that we got freedom for the rest of the
women.'</p>

<p>'Hear! Hear!'</p>

<p>'Rot!'</p>

<p>'W'y don't the men 'elp ye to get yer rights?'</p>

<p>'Here's some one asking why the men don't help. It's partly
they don't understand yet&mdash;they <i>will</i> before we've done!' She
wagged her head in a sort of comical menace, and the crowd
screamed with laughter&mdash;'partly, they don't understand yet
what's at stake&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Lord!' said an old fellow, with a rich chuckle. 'She's a educatin'
of <a name="Page_252t" id="Page_252t"></a><a href="#Page_252tn">us!'</a></p>

<p>'&mdash;and partly that the bravest man is afraid of ridicule. Oh,
yes, we've heard a great deal all our lives about the timidity and
the sensitiveness of women. And it's true&mdash;we <i>are</i> sensitive.
But I tell you, ridicule crumples a man up. It steels a woman.
We've come to know the value of ridicule. We've educated
ourselves so that we welcome ridicule. We owe our sincerest
thanks to the comic writers. The cartoonist is our unconscious
friend. Who cartoons people who are of no importance? What
advertisement is so sure of being remembered? If we didn't
know it by any other sign, the comic papers would tell us&mdash;<i>we've
arrived</i>!'</p>

<p>She stood there for one triumphant moment in an attitude of
such audacious self-confidence, that Jean turned excitedly to her
lover with&mdash;</p>

<p>'I know what she's like! The girl in Ibsen's "Master
Builder"!'</p>

<p>'I don't think I know the young lady.'</p>

<p>'Oh, there was a knock at the door that set the Master Builder's
nerves quivering. He felt in his bones it was the Younger Generation
coming to upset things. He <i>thought</i> it was a young man&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And it was really Miss Ernestine Blunt? He has my sympathies.'</p>

<p>The Younger Generation was declaring from the monument&mdash;</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>'Our greatest debt of gratitude we owe to the man who called
us female hooligans!'</p>

<p>That tickled the crowd, too; she was such a charming little
pink-cheeked specimen of a hooligan.</p>

<p>'I'm being frightfully amused, Geoffrey,' said Jean.</p>

<p>He looked down at her with a large indulgence. 'That's
right,' he said.</p>

<p>'We aren't hooligans, but we hope the fact will be overlooked.
If everybody said we were nice, well-behaved women, who'd
come to hear us? <i>Not the men.</i>'</p>

<p>The people dissolved in laughter, but she was grave enough.</p>

<p>'Men tell us it isn't womanly for us to care about politics.
How do they know what's womanly? It's for women to
decide that. Let them attend to being manly. It will take
them all their time.'</p>

<p>'Pore benighted man!'</p>

<p>'Some of you have heard it would be dreadful if we got the
vote, because then we'd be pitted against men in the economic
struggle. But it's too late to guard against that. It's fact.
But facts, we've discovered, are just what men find it so hard to
recognize. Men are so dreadfully sentimental.' She smiled
with the crowd at that, but she proceeded to hammer in her pet
nail. 'They won't recognize those eighty-two women out of
every hundred who are wage-earners. We used to believe
men when they told us that it was unfeminine&mdash;hardly
respectable&mdash;for women to be students and to aspire to the
arts that bring fame and fortune. But men have never told us it
was unfeminine for women to do the heavy drudgery that's badly
paid. That kind of work had to be done by somebody, and
men didn't hanker after it. <i>Oh</i>, no! Let the women scrub
and cook and wash, or teach without diplomas on half pay.
That's all right. But if they want to try their hand at the better-rewarded
work of the liberal professions&mdash;oh, very unfeminine
indeed.'</p>

<p>As Ernestine proceeded to show how all this obsolete unfairness
had its roots in political inequality, Lady John dropped her glass
with a sigh.</p>

<p>'You are right,' she said to Jean. 'This is Hilda, harnessed
to a purpose. A portent to shake middle-aged nerves.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>With Jean blooming there before him, Stonor had no wish to
prove his own nerves middle-aged.</p>

<p>'I think she's rather fun, myself. Though she ought to be
taken home and well smacked.'</p>

<p>Somebody had interrupted to ask, 'If the House of Commons
won't give you justice, why don't you go to the House of Lords?'</p>

<p>'What?' She hadn't heard, but the question was answered
by some one who had.</p>

<p>'She'd 'ave to 'urry up. Case of early closin'!'</p>

<p>'You'll be allowed to ask any question you like,' she said, 'at
the end of the meeting.'</p>

<p>'Wot's that? Oh, is it question time? I s'y, miss, 'oo killed
Cock Robin?'</p>

<p>'I've got a question, too,' a boy called through his hollowed
hands. 'Are&mdash;you&mdash;married?'</p>

<p>'Ere's your chance. 'E's a bachelor.'</p>

<p>'Here's a man,' says Ernestine, 'asking, "If the women get
full citizenship, and a war is declared, will the women fight?"'</p>

<p>'Haw! haw!'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Yes. Just tell us <i>that</i>!'</p>

<p>'Well'&mdash;she smiled&mdash;'you know some say the whole trouble
about us is that we <i>do</i> fight. But it's only hard necessity makes
us do that. We don't want to fight&mdash;as men seem to&mdash;just
for fighting's sake. Women are for peace.'</p>

<p>'Hear! hear!'</p>

<p>'And when we have a share in public affairs there'll be less
likelihood of war. Wasn't it a woman, the Baroness von Suttner,
whose book about peace was the corner-stone of the Peace Congress?
Wasn't it that book that converted the millionaire maker
of armaments of war? Wasn't it the Baroness von Suttner's
book that made Nobel offer those great international prizes for
the Arts of Peace? I'm not saying women can't fight. But we
women know all war is evil, and we're for peace. Our part&mdash;we're
proud to remember it&mdash;our part has been to go about after
you men in war time and <i>pick up the pieces</i>!'</p>

<p>A great shout went up as the truth of that rolled in upon the
people.</p>

<p>'Yes; seems funny, doesn't it? You men blow people to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>bits, and then we come along and put them together again. If
you know anything about military nursing, you know a good deal
of our work has been done in the face of danger; <i>but it's always
been done</i>.'</p>

<p>'That's so. That's so.'</p>

<p>'Well, what of it?' said a voice. 'Women must do something
for their keep.'</p>

<p>'You complain that more and more we're taking away from
you men the work that's always been yours. You can't any
longer keep woman out of the industries. The only question is,
on what terms shall she continue to be in? As long as she's
in on bad terms, she's not only hurting herself, she's hurting you.
But if you're feeling discouraged about our competing with you,
we're willing to leave you your trade in war. Let the men take
life! We <i>give</i> life!' Her voice was once more moved and proud.
'No one will pretend ours isn't one of the dangerous trades either.
I won't say any more to you now, because we've got others to
speak to you, and a new woman helper that I want you to hear.'</p>

<p>With an accompaniment of clapping she retired to hold a hurried
consultation with the chairman.</p>

<p>Jean turned to see how Geoffrey had taken it. 'Well?'</p>

<p>He smiled down at her, echoing, 'Well?'</p>

<p>'Nothing so <i>very</i> reprehensible in what she said, was there?'</p>

<p>'Oh, "reprehensible"!'</p>

<p>'It makes one rather miserable all the same.'</p>

<p>He pressed his guardian arm the closer. 'You mustn't take
it as much to heart as all that.'</p>

<p>'I can't help it. I can't indeed, Geoffrey. I shall <i>never</i> be
able to make a speech like that.'</p>

<p>He stared, considerably taken aback. 'I hope not indeed.'</p>

<p>'Why? I thought you said you wanted me to&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'To make nice little speeches with composure? So I did. So
I do&mdash;&mdash;' as he looked down upon the upturned face he seemed
to lose his thread.</p>

<p>She was for helping him to recover it. 'Don't you remember
how you said&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That you have very pink cheeks? Well, I stick to it.'</p>

<p>She smiled. 'Sh! Don't tell everybody.'</p>

<p>'And you're the only female creature&mdash;&mdash;'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>'That's a most proper sentiment.'</p>

<p>'The only one I ever saw who didn't look a fright in motor
things.'</p>

<p>'I'm glad you don't think me a fright. Oh!'&mdash;she turned
at the sound of applause&mdash;'we're forgetting all about&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>A big sandy man, not hitherto seen, was rolling his loose-knit
body up and down the platform, smiling at the people and mopping
a great bony skull, on which, low down, a few scanty wisps
of colourless hair were growing.</p>

<p>'If you can't afford a bottle of Tatcho,' a boy called out, 'w'y
don't you get yer 'air cut?'</p>

<p>He just shot out one hand and wagged it in grotesque greeting,
not in the least discomposed.</p>

<p>'I've been addressin' a big meetin' at 'Ammersmith this morning,
and w'en I told 'em I wus comin' 'ere this awfternoon to
speak fur the women&mdash;well&mdash;then the usual thing began.'</p>

<p>An appreciative roar rose from the crowd.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he grinned, 'if you want peace and quiet at a public
meetin', better not go mentionin' the lydies these times!'</p>

<p>He stopped, and the crowd filled in the hiatus with laughter.</p>

<p>'There wus a man at 'Ammersmith, too, talkin' about Woman's
sphere bein' 'Ome. 'Ome do you call it? <i>'Ome!</i>' and at the
word his <i>bonhomie</i> suffered a singular eclipse. '&rsquo;Ome!' he bellowed,
as if some one had struck him in a vital spot, and the word
was merely a roar of pain. '<i>'Ome!</i> You've got a kennel w'ere
you can munch your tommy. You got a corner w'ere you can
curl up fur a few hours till you go out to work again. But 'omes!
No, my men, there's too many of you ain't able to <i>give</i> the women
'omes fit to live in; too many of you in that fix fur you to go on
jawin' at those o' the women 'oo want to myke the 'omes a little
more deservin' o' the name.'</p>

<p>'If the vote ain't done us any good,' a man bawled up at him,
'&rsquo;ow'll it do the women any good?'</p>

<p>'Look 'ere! See 'ere!' he rolled his shapeless body up and
down the stone platform, taking in great draughts of cheer from
some invisible fountain. 'Any men here belongin' to the Labour
Party?' he inquired.</p>

<p>To an accompaniment of shouts and applause he went on,
smiling and rubbing his hands in a state of bubbling Brotherliness.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well, I don't need tell those men the vote 'as done us <i>some</i>
good. They <i>know</i> it. And it'll do us a lot more good w'en you
know 'ow to use the power you got in your 'and.'</p>

<p>'Power!' grumbled an old fellow. 'It's those fellows at the
bottom of the street'&mdash;he hitched his head toward St. Stephen's&mdash;'it's
them that's got the power.'</p>

<p>The speaker pounced on him. 'It's you and men like you
that give it to them. Wot did you do last election? You carried
the Liberals into Parliament Street on your own shoulders. You
believed all their fine words. You never asked yerselves, "Wot's
a Liberal, anyway?"'</p>

<p>In the chorus of cheers and booing some one sang out, 'He's
a jolly good fellow!'</p>

<p>'No 'e ain't,' said the Labour man, with another wheel about
and a pounce. 'No 'e ain't, or, if 'e's jolly, it's only because 'e
thinks you're such a cod-fish you'll go swellin' 'is majority again.'</p>

<p>Stonor joined in that laugh. He rather liked the man.</p>

<p>'Yes, it's enough to make any Liberal "jolly" to see a sheep
like you lookin' on, proud and 'appy, while you see Liberal leaders
desertin' Liberal principles.'</p>

<p>Through the roar of protest and argument, he held out those
grotesque great hands of his with the suggestion&mdash;</p>

<p>'You show me a Liberal, and I'll show you a Mr. Facing-both-ways.
Yuss. The Liberal, 'e sheds the light of his warm
and 'andsome smile on the workin' man, and round on the other
side 'e's tippin' the wink to the great landowners. Yuss. That's
to let 'em know 'e's standin' between them and Socialists. Ha!
the Socialists!' Puffing and flushed and perspiring he hurled it
out again and again over the heads of the people. 'The Socialists!
Yuss. <i>Socialists!</i> Ha! ha!' When he and the audience had
a little calmed down, 'The Liberal,' he said, with that look of
sly humour, '&rsquo;e's the judicial sort o' chap that sits in the middle.'</p>

<p>'On the fence.'</p>

<p>He nodded. 'Tories one side, Socialists the other. Well,
it ain't always so comfortable in the middle. No. Yer like to
get squeezed. Now, I says to the women, wot I says is, the Conservatives
don't promise you much, but wot they promise they
<i>do</i>.' He whacked one fist into the other with tremendous effect.</p>

<p>'This fellow isn't half bad,' Stonor said to Lady John.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>'But the Liberals, they'll promise you the earth and give you
the whole o' nothin'.'</p>

<p>There were roars of approval. Liberal stock had sunk rather
low in Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p>'Isn't it fun?' said Jean. 'Now aren't you glad I brought
you?'</p>

<p>'Oh, this chap's all right!'</p>

<p>'We men 'ave seen it 'appen over and over. But the women
can tyke an 'int quicker 'n what we can. They won't stand the
nonsense men do. Only they 'aven't got a fair chawnce even
to agitate fur their rights. As I wus comin' up ere, I 'eard a man
sayin', "Look at this big crowd. W'y, we're all <i>men</i>! If the
women want the vote, w'y ain't they here to s'y <a name="Page_258t" id="Page_258t"></a><a href="#Page_258tn">so?"</a> Well, I'll
tell you w'y. It's because they've 'ad to get the dinner fur you
and me, and now they're washin' up dishes.'</p>

<p>'D'you think we ought to st'y at 'ome and wash the dishes?'</p>

<p>He laughed with good-natured shrewdness. 'Well, if they'd
leave it to us once or twice per'aps we'd understand a little more
about the Woman Question. I know w'y <i>my</i> wife isn't here.
It's because she <i>knows</i> I can't cook, and she's 'opin' I can talk
to some purpose. Yuss,'&mdash;he acknowledged another possible
view,&mdash;'yuss, maybe she's mistaken. Any'ow, here I am to
vote for her and all the other women, and to&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>They nearly drowned him with '<i>Oh-h!</i>' and 'Hear! hear!'</p>

<p>'And to tell you men what improvements you can expect to
see w'en women 'as the share in public affairs they ought to 'ave!'</p>

<p>Out of the babel came the question, 'What do you know about
it? You can't even talk grammar.'</p>

<p>His broad smile faltered a little.</p>

<p>'Oh, what shame!' said Jean, full of sympathy. 'He's a dear&mdash;that
funny cockney.'</p>

<p>But he had been dashed for the merest moment.</p>

<p>'I'm not 'ere to talk grammar, but to talk Reform. I ain't
defendin' my grammar,' he said, on second thoughts, 'but I'll
say in pawssing that if my mother 'ad 'ad 'er rights, maybe my
grammar would 'ave been better.'</p>

<p>It was a thrust that seemed to go home. But, all the same,
it was clear that many of his friends couldn't stomach the sight
of him up there demeaning himself by espousing the cause of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Suffragettes. He kept on about woman and justice, but his
performance was little more than vigorous pantomime. The
boyish chairman looked harassed and anxious, Miss Ernestine
Blunt alert, watchful.</p>

<p>Stonor bent his head to whisper something in Jean Dunbarton's
ear. She listened with lowered eyes and happy face. The discreet
little interchange went on for several minutes, while the
crowd booed at the bald-headed Labourite for his mistaken
enthusiasm. Geoffrey Stonor and his bride-to-be were more
alone now in the midst of this shouting mob than they had been
since the Ulland House luncheon-gong had broken in upon and
banished momentary wonderment about the name&mdash;that name
beginning with V. Plain to see in the flushed and happy face
that Jean Dunbarton was not 'asking questions.' She was
listening absorbed to the oldest of all the stories.</p>

<p>And now the champion of the Suffragettes had come to the
surface again with his&mdash;</p>

<p>'Wait a bit&mdash;'arf a minute, my man.'</p>

<p>'Oo you talkin' to? I ain't your man!'</p>

<p>'Oh, that's lucky for me. There seems to be an individual
here who doesn't think women ought to 'ave the vote.'</p>

<p>'One? Oh-h!'</p>

<p>They all but wiped him out again in laughter; but he climbed
on the top of the great wave of sound with&mdash;</p>

<p>'P'raps the gentleman who thinks they oughtn't to 'ave a
vote, p'raps 'e don't know much about women. Wot? Oh, the
gentleman says 'e's married. Well, then, fur the syke of 'is wife
we mustn't be too sorry 'e's 'ere. No doubt she's s'ying, "'Eaven
be prysed those women are mykin' a demonstrytion in Trafalgar
Square, and I'll 'ave a little peace and quiet at 'ome for one Sunday
in me life."'</p>

<p>The crowd liked that, and found themselves jeering at the
interrupter as well as at the speaker.</p>

<p>'Why, you'&mdash;he pointed at some one in the crowd&mdash;'<i>you</i>'re
like the man at 'Ammersmith this morning. 'E wus awskin' me,
"'Ow would you like men to st'y at 'ome and do the fam'ly
washin'?" I told 'im I wouldn't advise it. I 'ave too much
respect fur'&mdash;they waited while slyly he brought out&mdash;'me
clo'es.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>'It's their place,' said some one in a rage; 'the women <i>ought</i>
to do the washin'.'</p>

<p>'I'm not sure you aren't right. For a good many o' you fellas
from the look o' you, you cawn't even wash yourselves.'</p>

<p>This was outrageous. It was resented in an incipient riot.
The helmets of the police bobbed about. An angry voice had
called out&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oo are you talkin' to?'</p>

<p>The anxiety of the inexperienced chairman was almost touching.</p>

<p>The Socialist revelled in the disturbance he'd created. He
walked up and down with that funny rolling gait, poking out
his head at intervals in a turtle-esque fashion <a name="Page_260t" id="Page_260t"></a><a href="#Page_260tn">highly</a> provocative,
holding his huge paws kangaroo fashion, only with fingers
stiffly pointed, and shooting them out at intervals towards the
crowd in a very ecstasy of good-natured contempt.</p>

<p>'Better go 'ome and awsk yer wife to wash yer fice,' he advised.
'<i>You</i> cawn't even do <i>that</i> bit o' fam'ly washin'. Go and awsk
<i>some</i> woman.'</p>

<p>There was a scuffle in the crowd. A section of it surged up
towards the monument.</p>

<p>'Which of us d'you mean?' demanded a threatening voice.</p>

<p>'Well,' said the Socialist, coolly looking down, 'it takes about
ten of your sort to make a man, so you may take it I mean the
lot of you.' Again the hands shot out and scattered scorn amongst
his critics.</p>

<p>There were angry, indistinguishable retorts, and the crowd
swayed. Miss Ernestine Blunt, who had been watching the
fray with serious face, turned suddenly, catching sight of some one
just arrived at the end of the platform. She jumped up, saying
audibly to the speaker as she passed him, 'Here she is,' and
proceeded to offer her hand to help some one to get up the improvised
steps behind the lion.</p>

<p>The Socialist had seized with fervour upon his last chance,
and was flinging out showers of caustic advice among his foes,
stirring them up to frenzy.</p>

<p>Stonor, with contracted brows, had stared one dazed instant
as the head of the new-comer came up behind the lion on the
left.</p>

<p>Jean, her eyes wide, incredulous, as though unable to accept
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>their testimony, pressed a shade nearer the monument. Stonor
made a sharp move forward, and took her by the arm.</p>

<p>'We're going now,' he said.</p>

<p>'Not yet&mdash;oh, <i>please</i> not just yet,' she pleaded as he drew
her round. 'Geoffrey, I do believe&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She looked back, with an air almost bewildered, over her
shoulder, like one struggling to wake from a dream.</p>

<p>Stonor was saying with decision to Lady John, 'I'm going to
take Jean out of this mob. Will you come?'</p>

<p>'What? Oh, yes, if you think'&mdash;she had disengaged the chain
of her eyeglass at last. 'But isn't that, surely it's&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Geoffrey&mdash;&mdash;!' Jean began.</p>

<p>'Lady John's tired,' he interrupted. 'We've had enough of
this idiotic&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But you don't see who it is, Geoffrey. That last one is&mdash;&mdash;'
Suddenly Jean bent forward as he was trying to extricate her from
the crowd, and she looked in his face. Something that she found
there made her tighten her hold on his arm.</p>

<p>'We can't run away and leave Aunt Ellen,' was all she said;
but her voice sounded scared. Stonor repressed a gesture of
anger, and came to a standstill just behind two big policemen.</p>

<p>The last-comer to that strange platform, after standing for
some seconds with her back to the people and talking to Ernestine
Blunt, the tall figure in a long sage-green dust coat and familiar
hat, had turned and glanced apprehensively at the crowd.</p>

<p>It was Vida Levering.</p>

<p>The girl down in the crowd locked her hands together and
stood motionless.</p>

<p>The Socialist had left the platform with the threat that he
was 'coming down now to attend to that microbe that's vitiating
the air on my right, while a lady will say a few words to you&mdash;if
she can myke 'erself 'eard.'</p>

<p>He retired to a chorus of cheers and booing, while the chairman,
more harassed than ever, it would seem, but determined
to create a diversion, was saying that some one had suggested&mdash;'and
it's such a good idea I'd like you to listen to it&mdash;that a
clause shall be inserted in the next Suffrage Bill that shall expressly
give to each Cabinet Minister, and to any respectable man, the
power to prevent a vote being given to the female members of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>family, on his public declaration of their lack of sufficient intelligence
to entitle them to one.'</p>

<p>'Oh! oh!'</p>

<p>'Now, I ask you to listen as quietly as you can to a lady who
is not accustomed to speaking&mdash;a&mdash;in Trafalgar Square, or&mdash;a&mdash;as
a matter of fact, at all.'</p>

<p>'A dumb lady!'</p>

<p>'Hooray!'</p>

<p>'Three cheers for the dumb lady!'</p>

<p>The chairman was dreadfully flustered at the unfortunate
turn his speech had taken.</p>

<p>'A lady who, as I've said, will tell you, if you'll behave yourselves&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh! oh!'</p>

<p>'Will tell you something of her impression of police-court
justice in this country.'</p>

<p>Jean stole a wondering look at Stonor's sphinx-like face as Vida
Levering came forward.</p>

<p>There she stood, obviously very much frightened, with the
unaccustomed colour coming and going in her white face&mdash;farther
back than any of the practised speakers&mdash;there she stood
like one who too much values the space between her and the mob
voluntarily to lessen it by half an inch. The voice was steady
enough, though low, as she began.</p>

<p>'Mr. Chairman, men, and women&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Speak up.'</p>

<p>She flushed, came nearer to the edge of the platform, and
raised the key a little.</p>

<p>'I just wanted to tell you that I was&mdash;I was present in the
police court when the women were charged for creating a disturbance.'</p>

<p>'You oughtn't to get mix'd up in wot didn't concern you!'</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;' She stumbled and stopped.</p>

<p>'Give the lady a hearing,' said a shabby art-student, magisterially.
He seemed not ill-pleased when he had drawn a certain
number of eyes to his long hair, picturesque hat, and flowing
Byronic tie.</p>

<p>'Wot's the lydy's nyme?'</p>

<p>'I ain't seen this one before.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>'Is she Mrs. or Miss?'</p>

<p>'She's dumb, anyway, like 'e said.'</p>

<p>'Haw! haw!'</p>

<p>The anxious chairman was fidgeting in an agony of apprehension.
He whispered some kind prompting word after he had
flung out&mdash;</p>

<p>'Now, see here, men; fair play, you know.'</p>

<p>'I think I ought&mdash;&mdash;' Vida began.</p>

<p>'No wonder she can't find a word to say for 'em. They're
a disgryce, miss&mdash;them women behind you. It's the w'y they
goes on as mykes the Govermint keep ye from gettin' yer rights.'</p>

<p>The chairman had lost his temper. 'It's the way <i>you</i> go on,'
he screamed; but the din was now so great, not even he could be
heard. He stood there waving his arms and moving his lips
while his dark eyes glittered.</p>

<p>Miss Levering turned and pantomimed to Ernestine, 'You see
it's no use!'</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, the girl came forward, and said something
in the ear of the frantic chairman. When he stopped gyrating,
and nodded, Miss Blunt came to the edge of the platform, and
held up her hand as if determined to stem this tide of unfavourable
comment upon the dreadful women who were complicating the
Election difficulties of both parties.</p>

<p>'Listen,' says Ernestine; 'I've got something to propose.'
They waited an instant to hear what this precious proposal might
be. 'If the Government withholds the vote because they don't
like the way some of us ask for it, let them give it to the quiet
ones. Do they want to punish all women because they don't
like the manners of a handful? Perhaps that's men's notion of
justice. It isn't ours.'</p>

<p>'Haw! haw!'</p>

<p>'Yes'&mdash;Miss Levering plucked up courage, seeing her friend
sailing along so safely. 'This is the first time I've ever "gone
on," as you call it, but they never gave me a vote.'</p>

<p>'<i>No</i>,' says Miss Ernestine, with energy&mdash;'and there are'&mdash;she
turned briskly, with forefinger uplifted punctuating her
count&mdash;'there are two, three, four women on this platform.
Now, we all want the vote, as you know.'</p>

<p>'Lord, yes, we know <i>that</i>.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well, we'd agree to be disfranchised all our lives if they'd
give the vote to all the other women.'</p>

<p>'Look here! You made one speech&mdash;give the lady a chance.'</p>

<p>Miss Blunt made a smiling little bob of triumph. 'That's
just what I wanted you to say!' And she retired.</p>

<p>Miss Levering came forward again. But the call to 'go on'
had come a little suddenly.</p>

<p>'Perhaps you&mdash;you don't know&mdash;you don't know&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'<i>How</i>'re we going to know if you can't tell us?' demanded a
sarcastic voice.</p>

<p>It steadied her. 'Thank you for that,' she said, smiling.
'We couldn't have a better motto. How <i>are</i> you to know if we
can't somehow manage to tell you?' With a visible effort she
went on, 'Well, <i>I</i> certainly didn't know before that the sergeants
and policemen are instructed to deceive the people as to the time
such cases are heard.'</p>

<p>'It's just as hard,' said a bystander to his companion, '<i>just</i>
as hard for learned counsel in the august quiet of the Chancery
Division to find out when their cases are really coming on.'</p>

<p>'You ask, and you're sent to Marlborough Police Court,' said
Miss Levering, 'instead of to Marylebone.'</p>

<p>'They oughter send yer to 'Olloway&mdash;do y' good.'</p>

<p>'You go on, miss. Nobody minds 'im.'</p>

<p>'Wot can you expect from a pig but a grunt?'</p>

<p>'You are told the case will be at two o'clock, and it's really
called for eleven. Well, I took a great deal of trouble, and I
didn't believe what I was told.' She was warming a little to her
task. 'Yes, that's almost the first thing we have to learn&mdash;to
get over our touching faith that because a man tells us something,
it's true. I got to the right court, and I was so anxious not to
be late, I was too early.'</p>

<p>'Like a woman!'</p>

<p>'The case before the Suffragists' was just coming on. I heard
a noise. I saw the helmets of two policemen.'</p>

<p>'No, you didn't. They don't wear their helmets in court.'</p>

<p>'They were coming in from the corridor. As I saw them, I
said to myself, "What sort of crime shall I have to sit and hear
about? Is this a burglar being brought along between the two
big policemen, or will it be a murderer? What sort of felon is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>to stand in the dock before the people, whose crime is, they ask
for the vote<a name="Page_265t" id="Page_265t"></a><a href="#Page_265tn">?"</a> But try as I would, I couldn't see the prisoner. My
heart misgave me. Is it some poor woman, I wondered?'</p>

<p>A tipsy tramp, with his battered bowler over one eye, wheezed
out, 'Drunk again!' with an accent of weary philosophy. 'Syme
old tyle.'</p>

<p>'Then the policemen got nearer, and I saw'&mdash;she waited an
instant&mdash;'a little thin, half-starved boy. What do you think
he was charged with?'</p>

<p>'Travellin' first with a third-class ticket.' A boy offered a
page out of personal history.</p>

<p>'Stealing. What had he been stealing, that small criminal?
<i>Milk.</i> It seemed to me, as I sat there looking on, that the men
who had had the affairs of the world in their hands from the beginning,
and who've made so poor a business of it&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, pore devils! give 'em a rest!'</p>

<p>'Who've made so bad a business of it as to have the poor and
the unemployed in the condition they're in to-day, whose only
remedy for a starving child is to hale him off to the police court,
because he had managed to get a little milk, well, I did wonder
that the men refuse to be helped with a problem they've so notoriously
failed at. I began to say to myself, "Isn't it time the
women lent a hand?"'</p>

<p>'Doin' pretty well fur a dumb lady!'</p>

<p>'Would you have women magistrates?'</p>

<p>She was stumped by the suddenness of the query.</p>

<p>'Haw! haw! Magistrates and judges! <i>Women!</i>'</p>

<p>'Let 'em prove first they're able to&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>It was more than the shabby art-student could stand.</p>

<p>'The schools are full of them!' he shouted. 'Where's their
Michael Angelo? They study music by thousands: where's
their Beethoven? Where's their Plato? Where's the woman
Shakespeare?'</p>

<p>'Where's their Harry Lauder?'</p>

<p>At last a name that stirred the general enthusiasm.</p>

<p>'Who is Harry Lauder?' Jean asked her aunt.</p>

<p>Lady John shook her head.</p>

<p>'Yes, wot 'ave women ever <i>done</i>?'</p>

<p>The speaker had clenched her hands, but she was not going
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>to lose her presence of mind again. By the time the chairman
could make himself heard with, 'Now, men, it's one of our British
characteristics that we're always ready to give the people we differ
from a hearing,' Miss Levering, making the slightest of gestures,
waved him aside with a low&mdash;</p>

<p>'It's all right.'</p>

<p>'These questions are quite proper,' she said, raising her voice.
'They are often asked elsewhere; and I would like to ask in
return: Since when was human society held to exist for its handful
of geniuses? How many Platos are there here in this crowd?'</p>

<p>'Divil a wan!' And a roar of laughter followed that free confession.</p>

<p>'Not one,' she repeated. 'Yet that doesn't keep you men off
the register. How many Shakespeares are there in all England
to-day? Not one. Yet the State doesn't tumble to pieces.
Railroads and ships are built, homes are kept going, and babies
are born. The world goes on'&mdash;she bent over the crowd with
lit eyes&mdash;'the world goes on <i>by virtue of its common people</i>.'</p>

<p>There was a subdued 'Hear! hear!'</p>

<p>'I am not concerned that you should think we women could
paint great pictures, or compose immortal music, or write good
books. I am content'&mdash;and it was strange to see the pride with
which she said it, a pride that might have humbled Vere de
Vere&mdash;'I am content that we should be classed with the common
people, who keep the world going. But'&mdash;her face grew softer,
there was even a kind of camaraderie where before there had
been shrinking&mdash;'I'd like the world to go a great deal better.
We were talking about justice. I have been inquiring into the
kind of lodging the poorest class of homeless women can get in
this town of London. I find that only the men of that class are
provided for. Some measure to establish Rowton Houses for
Women has been before the London County Council. They
looked into the question very carefully&mdash;so their apologists say.
And what did they decide? They decided that they could do
nothing.</p>

<p>'Why could that great, all-powerful body do nothing? Because,
they said, if these cheap and decent houses were opened,
the homeless women in the streets would make use of them.
You'll think I'm not in earnest, but that was actually the decision,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>and the reason given for it. Women that the bitter struggle for
existence had forced into a life of horror might take advantage
of the shelter these decent, cheap places offered. But the <i>men</i>,
I said! Are the men who avail themselves of Lord Rowton's
hostels, are <i>they</i> all angels? Or does wrong-doing in a man not
matter? Yet women are recommended to depend on the chivalry
of men!'</p>

<p>The two tall policemen who had been standing for some minutes
in front of Mr. Stonor in readiness to serve him, seeming to feel
there was no further need of them in this quarter, shouldered their
way to the left, leaving exposed the hitherto masked figure of
the tall gentleman in the motor cap. He moved uneasily, and,
looking round, he met Jean's eyes fixed on him. As each looked
away again, each saw that for the first time Vida Levering had
become aware of his presence. A change passed over her face,
and her figure swayed as if some species of mountain-sickness
had assailed her, looking down from that perilous high perch of
hers upon the things of the plain. While the people were asking
one another, 'What is it? Is she going to faint?' she lifted one
hand to her eyes, and her fingers trembled an instant against the
lowered lids. But as suddenly as she had faltered, she was forging
on again, repeating like an echo of a thing heard in a dream&mdash;</p>

<p>'Justice and chivalry! Justice and chivalry remind me of
the story that those of you who read the police-court news&mdash;I
have begun only lately to do that&mdash;but <i>you</i>'ve seen the accounts
of the girl who's been tried in Manchester lately for the murder
of her child.'</p>

<p>People here and there in the crowd regaled one another with
choice details of the horror.</p>

<p>'Not pleasant reading. Even if we'd noticed it, we wouldn't
speak of it in my world. A few months ago I should have turned
away my eyes and forgotten even the headline as quickly as I
could.'</p>

<p>'My opinion,' said a shrewd-looking young man, 'is that she's
forgot what she meant to say, and just clutched at this to keep
her from drying up.'</p>

<p>'Since that morning in the police-court I read these things.
This, as you know, was the story of a working girl&mdash;an orphan
of seventeen&mdash;who crawled with the dead body of her new-born
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>child to her master's back door and left the baby there. She
dragged herself a little way off and fainted. A few days later
she found herself in court being tried for the murder of her child.
Her master, a married man, had of course reported the "find"
at his back door to the police, and he had been summoned to give
evidence. The girl cried out to him in the open court, "You are
the father!" He couldn't deny it. The coroner, at the jury's
request, censured the man, and regretted that the law didn't
make him responsible. But'&mdash;she leaned down from the plinth
with eyes blazing&mdash;'he went scot free. And that girl is at this
moment serving her sentence in Strangeways Gaol.'</p>

<p>Through the moved and murmuring crowd, Jean forced her
way, coming in between Lady John and Stonor, who stood there
immovable. The girl strained to bring her lips near his ear.</p>

<p>'Why do you dislike her so?'</p>

<p>'I?' he said. 'Why should you think&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I never saw you look as you did;' with a vaguely frightened
air she added, 'as you do.'</p>

<p>'Men make boast'&mdash;the voice came clear from the monument&mdash;'that
an English citizen is tried by his peers. What woman
is tried by hers?'</p>

<p>'She mistakes the sense in which the word was employed,' said
a man who looked like an Oxford Don.</p>

<p>But there was evidently a sense, larger than that one purely
academic, in which her use of the word could claim its pertinence.
The strong feeling that had seized her as she put the question
was sweeping the crowd along with her.</p>

<p>'A woman is arrested by a man, brought before a man judge,
tried by a jury of men, condemned by men, taken to prison by
a man, and by a man she's hanged! Where in all this were <i>her</i>
"peers"? Why did men, when British justice was born&mdash;why
did they so long ago insist on trial by "a jury of their peers"?
So that justice shouldn't miscarry&mdash;wasn't it? A man's peers
would best understand his circumstances, his temptation, the
degree of his guilt. Yet there's no such unlikeness between
different classes of men as exists between man and woman. What
man has the knowledge that makes him a fit judge of woman's
deeds at that time of anguish&mdash;that hour that some woman
struggled through to put each man here into the world. I noticed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>when a previous speaker quoted the Labour Party, you applauded.
Some of you here, I gather, call yourselves Labour men. Every
woman who has borne a child is a Labour woman. No man
among you can judge what she goes through in her hour of darkness.'</p>

<p>Jean's eyes had dropped from her lover's set white face early
in the recital. But she whispered his name.</p>

<p>He seemed not to hear.</p>

<p>The speaker up there had caught her fluttering breath, and
went on so low that people strained to follow.</p>

<p>'In that great agony, even under the best conditions that money
and devotion can buy, many a woman falls into temporary mania,
and not a few go down to death. In the case of this poor little
abandoned working girl, what man can be the fit judge of her
deeds in that awful moment of half-crazed temptation? Women
know of these things as those know burning who have walked
through fire.'</p>

<p>Stonor looked down at the girl at his side. He saw her hands
go up to her throat as though she were suffocating. The young
face, where some harsh knowledge was struggling for birth, was
in pity turned away from the man she loved.</p>

<p>The woman leaned down from the platform, and spoke her
last words with a low and thrilling earnestness.</p>

<p>'I would say in conclusion to the women here, it's not enough
to be sorry for these, our unfortunate sisters. We must get the
conditions of life made fairer. We women must organize. We
must learn to work together. We have all (rich and poor, happy
and unhappy) worked so long and so exclusively for men, we
hardly know how to work for one another. But we must learn.
Those who can, may give money. Those who haven't pennies
to give, even those people are not so poor but what they can give
some part of their labour&mdash;some share of their sympathy and
support. I know of a woman&mdash;she isn't of our country&mdash;but
a woman who, to help the women strikers of an oppressed industry
to hold out, gave a thousand pounds a week for thirteen weeks
to get them and their children bread, and help them to stand
firm. The masters were amazed. Week after week went by,
and still the people weren't starved into submission. Where
did this mysterious stream of help come from? The employers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>couldn't discover, and they gave in. The women got back their
old wages, and I am glad to say many of them began to put by
pennies to help a little to pay back the great sum that had been
advanced to them.'</p>

<p>'She took their pennies&mdash;a rich woman like that?'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;to use again, as well as to let the working women feel
they were helping others. I hope you'll all join the Union. Come
up after the meeting is over and give us your names.'</p>

<p>As she turned away, 'You won't get any men!' a taunting voice
called after her.</p>

<p>The truth in the gibe seemed to sting. Forestalling the chairman,
quickly she confronted the people again, a new fire in her
eyes.</p>

<p>'Then,' she said, holding out her hands&mdash;'then <i>it is to the
women I appeal</i>!' She stood so an instant, stilling the murmur,
and holding the people by that sudden concentration of passion
in her face. 'I don't mean to say it wouldn't be better if men
and women did this work together, shoulder to shoulder. But
the mass of men won't have it so. I only hope they'll realize in
time the good they've renounced and the spirit they've aroused.
For I know as well as any man could tell me, it would be a bad
day for England if all women felt about all men <i>as I do</i>.'</p>

<p>She retired in a tumult. The others on the platform closed
about her. The chairman tried in vain to get a hearing from the
swaying and dissolving crowd.</p>

<p>Jean made a blind forward movement towards the monument.
Stonor called out, in a toneless voice&mdash;</p>

<p>'Here! follow me!'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;no&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;' The girl pressed on.</p>

<p>'You're going the wrong way.'</p>

<p>'<i>This</i> is the way&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We can get out quicker on this side.'</p>

<p>'I don't <i>want</i> to get out.'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>He had left Lady John, and was following Jean through the
press.</p>

<p>'Where are you going?' he asked sharply.</p>

<p>'To ask that woman to let me have the honour of working
with her.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>The crowd surged round the girl.</p>

<p>'Jean!' he called upon so stern a note that people stared and
stopped.</p>

<p>Others&mdash;not Jean.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p>A little before six o'clock on that same Sunday, Jean Dunbarton
opened the communicating door between her own little
sitting-room and the big bare drawing-room of her grandfather's
house in Eaton Square. She stood a moment on the threshold,
looking back over her shoulder, and then crossed the drawing-room,
treading softly on the parquet spaces between the rugs.
She went straight to the window, and was in the act of parting
the lace curtains to look out, when she heard the folding doors
open. With raised finger she turned to say 'Sh!' The servant
stood silently waiting, while she went back to the door she had
left open and with an air of caution closed it.</p>

<p>When she turned round again the butler had stepped aside to
admit Mr. Stonor. He came in with a quick impatient step;
but before he had time to get a word out&mdash;'Speak low, please,'
the girl said. He was obviously too much annoyed to pay much
heed to her request, which if he thought about it at all, he must
have interpreted as consideration for the ailing grandfather.</p>

<p>'I waited a full half-hour for you to come back,' he said in a
tone no lower than usual.</p>

<p>The girl had led the way to the side of the room furthest from
the communicating door. 'I am sorry,' she said dully.</p>

<p>'If you didn't mind leaving me like that,' he followed her up
with his arraignment, 'you might at least have considered Lady
John.'</p>

<p>'Is she here with you?' Jean stopped by the sofa near the
window.</p>

<p>'No,' he said curtly. 'My place was nearer than this and she
was tired. I left her to get some tea. We couldn't tell whether
you'd be here, or <i>what</i> had become of you!'</p>

<p>'Mr. Trent got us a hansom.'</p>

<p>'Trent?'</p>

<p>'The chairman of the meeting.'</p>

<p>'Got us&mdash;&mdash;?'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>'Miss Levering and me.'</p>

<p>Stonor's incensed face turned almost brick colour as he repeated,
'<i>Miss Lev</i>&mdash;&mdash;!'</p>

<p>Before he got the name out, the folding doors had opened again,
and the butler was saying, 'Mr. Farnborough.'</p>

<p>That young gentleman was far too anxious and flurried himself,
to have sufficient detachment of mind to consider the moods of
other people. 'At last!' he said, stopping short as soon as he
caught sight of Stonor.</p>

<p>'Don't speak loud, please,' said Miss Dunbarton; 'some one is
resting in the next room.'</p>

<p>'Oh, did you find your grandfather worse?'&mdash;but he never
waited to learn. 'You'll forgive the incursion when you hear'&mdash;he
turned abruptly to Stonor again. 'They've been telegraphing
you all over London,' he said, putting his hat down in the nearest
chair. 'In sheer despair they set me on your track.'</p>

<p>'Who did?'</p>

<p>Farnborough was fumbling agitatedly in his breast-pocket.
'There was the devil to pay at Dutfield last night. The Liberal
chap tore down from London, and took over your meeting.'</p>

<p>'Oh? Nothing about it in the Sunday paper I saw.'</p>

<p>'Wait till you see the press to-morrow! There was a great rally,
and the beggar made a rousing speech.'</p>

<p>'What about?'</p>

<p>'Abolition of the Upper House.'</p>

<p>'They were at that when I was at Eton.' Stonor turned on his
heel.</p>

<p>'Yes, but this man has got a way of putting things&mdash;the people
went mad.'</p>

<p>It was all very well for a mere girl to be staring indifferently out
of the window, while a great historic party was steering straight
for shipwreck; but it really was too much to see this man who
ought to be taking the situation with the seriousness it deserved,
strolling about the room with that abstracted air, looking superciliously
at Mr. Dunbarton's examples of the Glasgow school.
Farnborough balanced himself on wide-apart legs and thrust one
hand in his trousers' pocket. The other hand held a telegram.
'The Liberal platform as defined at Dutfield is going to make a
big difference,' he pronounced.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>'You think so,' said Stonor, dryly.</p>

<p>'Well, your agent says as much.' He pulled off the orange-brown
envelope, threw it and the reply-paid form on the table,
and held the message under the eyes of the obviously surprised
gentleman in front of him.</p>

<p>'My agent!' Stonor had echoed with faint incredulity.</p>

<p>He took the telegram. '"Try find Stonor,"' he read. 'H'm!
H'm!' His eyes ran on.</p>

<p>Farnborough looked first at the expressionless face, and then at
the message.</p>

<p>'You see!'&mdash;he glanced over Stonor's shoulder&mdash;'"tremendous
effect of last night's Liberal manifesto ought to be counteracted
in to-morrow's papers."' Then withdrawing a couple of paces,
he said very earnestly, 'You see, Mr. Stonor, it's a battle-cry we
want.'</p>

<p>'Clap-trap,' said the great man, throwing the telegram down on
the table.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Farnborough, distinctly dashed, 'they've been saying
we have nothing to offer but personal popularity. No practical
reform, no&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No truckling to the masses, I suppose.'</p>

<p>Poor Farnborough bit his lip. 'Well, in these democratic
days, you're obliged (I should <i>think</i>), to consider&mdash;&mdash;' In his
baulked and snubbed condition he turned to Miss Dunbarton for
countenance. 'I hope you'll forgive my bursting in like this,
but'&mdash;he gathered courage as he caught a glimpse of her averted
face&mdash;'I can see you realize the gravity of the situation.' He
found her in the embrasure of the window, and went on with an
air of speaking for her ear alone. 'My excuse for being so officious&mdash;you
see it isn't as if he were going to be a mere private
member. Everybody knows he'll be in the Cabinet.'</p>

<p>'It may be a Liberal Cabinet,' came from Stonor at his dryest.</p>

<p>Farnborough leapt back into the fray. 'Nobody thought so
up to last night. Why, even your brother&mdash;&mdash;' he brought up
short. 'But I'm afraid I'm really seeming rather <i>too</i>&mdash;&mdash;' He
took up his hat.</p>

<p>'What about my brother?'</p>

<p>'Oh, only that I went from your house to the club, you know&mdash;and
I met Lord Windlesham as I rushed up the Carlton steps.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'I told him the Dutfield news.'</p>

<p>Stonor turned sharply round. His face was much more interested
than any of his words had been.</p>

<p>As though in the silence, Stonor had asked a question, Farnborough
produced the answer.</p>

<p>'Your brother said it only confirmed his fears.'</p>

<p>'Said that, did he?' Stonor spoke half under his breath.</p>

<p>'Yes. Defeat is inevitable, he thinks, unless&mdash;&mdash;' Farnborough
waited, intently watching the big figure that had begun
pacing back and forth. It paused, but no word came, even the
eyes were not raised.</p>

<p>'Unless,' Farnborough went on, 'you can manufacture some
political dynamite within the next few hours. Those were his
words.'</p>

<p>As Stonor resumed his walk he raised his head and caught sight
of Jean's face. He stopped short directly in front of her.</p>

<p>'You are very tired,' he said.</p>

<p>'No, no.' She turned again to the window.</p>

<p>'I'm obliged to you for troubling about this,' he said, offering
Farnborough his hand with the air of civilly dismissing him.
'I'll see what can be done.'</p>

<p>Farnborough caught up the reply-paid form from the table.
'If you'd like to wire I'll take it.'</p>

<p>Faintly amused at this summary view of large complexities,
'You don't understand, my young friend,' he said, not unkindly.
'Moves of this sort are not rushed at by responsible politicians. I
must have time for consideration.'</p>

<p>Farnborough's face fell. 'Oh. Well, I only hope some one
else won't jump into the breach before you.' With his watch in
one hand, he held out the other to Miss Dunbarton. 'Good-bye.
I'll just go and find out what time the newspapers go to press on
Sunday. I'll be at the Club,' he threw over his shoulder, 'just
in case I can be of any use.'</p>

<p>'No; don't do that. If I should have anything new to say&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'B-b-but with our party, as your brother said, "heading straight
for a vast electoral disaster," and the Liberals&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'If I decide on a counter-blast, I shall simply telegraph to headquarters.
Good-bye.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh! A&mdash;a&mdash;good-bye.'</p>

<p>With a gesture of 'the country's going to the dogs,' Farnborough
opened the doors and closed them behind him.</p>

<p>Jean had rung the bell. She came back with her eyes on the
ground, and paused near the table where the crumpled envelope
made a dash of yellow-brown on the polished satinwood. Stonor
stood studying the carpet, more concern in his face now that there
was only Jean to see it.</p>

<p>'"Political dynamite," eh?' he repeated, walking a few paces
away. He returned with, 'After all, women are much more Conservative
<i>naturally</i> than men, aren't they?'</p>

<p>Jean's lowered eyes showed no spark of interest in the issue.
Her only motion, an occasional locking and unlocking of her
fingers. But no words came. He glanced at her, as if for the
first time conscious of her silence.</p>

<p>'You see now'&mdash;he threw himself into a chair&mdash;'one reason
why I've encouraged you to take an interest in public questions.
Because people like us don't go screaming about it, is no sign we
don't&mdash;some of us&mdash;see what's on the way. However little they
may want to, women of our class will have to come into line. All
the best things in the world, everything civilization has won, will
be in danger if&mdash;when this change comes&mdash;the only women who
have practical political training are the women of the lower classes.
Women of the lower classes,' he repeated, '<i>and</i>'&mdash;the line between
his eyebrows deepening&mdash;'women inoculated by the Socialist
virus.'</p>

<p>'Geoffrey!'</p>

<p>He was in no mood to discuss a concrete type. To so intelligent
a girl, a hint should be enough. He drew the telegraph-form that
still lay on the table towards him.</p>

<p>'Let us see how it would sound, shall we?'</p>

<p>He detached a gold pencil from one end of his watch-chain,
and, with face more and more intent, bent over the paper,
writing.</p>

<p>The girl opened her lips more than once to speak, and each time
fell back again on her silent, half-incredulous misery.</p>

<p>When Stonor finished writing, he held the paper off, smiling a
little, with the craftsman's satisfaction in his work, and more than
a touch of shrewd malice&mdash;</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>'Enough dynamite in that,' he commented. 'Rather too much,
isn't there, little girl?'</p>

<p>'Geoffrey, I know her story.'</p>

<p>He looked at her for the first time since Farnborough left the
room.</p>

<p>'Whose story?'</p>

<p>'Miss Levering's.'</p>

<p>'<i>Whose?</i>' He crushed the rough note of his manifesto into his
pocket.</p>

<p>'Vida Levering's.'</p>

<p>He stared at the girl, till across the moment's silence a cry of
misery went out&mdash;</p>

<p>'Why did you desert her?'</p>

<p>'I?' he said, like one staggered by the sheer wildness of the
charge. '<i>I?</i>'</p>

<p>But no comfort of doubting seemed to cross the darkness of
Jean's backward look into the past.</p>

<p>'Oh, why did you do it?'</p>

<p>'What, in the name of&mdash;&mdash;? What has she been saying to
you?'</p>

<p>'Some one else told me part. Then the way you looked when
you saw her at Aunt Ellen's&mdash;Miss Levering's saying you didn't
know her&mdash;then your letting out that you knew even the curious
name on the handkerchief&mdash;oh, I pieced it together.'</p>

<p>While she poured out the disjointed sentences, he had recovered
his self-possession.</p>

<p>'Your ingenuity is undeniable,' he said coldly, rising to his feet.
But he paused as the girl went on&mdash;</p>

<p>'And then when she said that at the meeting about "the dark
hour," and I looked at her face, it flashed over me&mdash;&mdash;Oh, why
did you desert her?'</p>

<p>It was as if the iteration of that charge stung him out of his chill
anger.</p>

<p>'I <i>didn't</i> desert her,' he said.</p>

<p>'Ah-h!' Her hands went fluttering up to her eyes, and hid the
quivering face. Something in the action touched him, his face
changed, and he made a sudden passionate movement toward the
trembling figure standing there with hidden eyes. In another
moment his arms would have been round her. Her muffled voice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>saying, 'I'm glad. I'm glad,' checked him. He stood bewildered,
making with noiseless lips the word '<i>Glad?</i>' She was 'glad' he
hadn't tired of her rival? The girl brushed the tears from her
eyes, and steadied herself against the table.</p>

<p>'She went away from you, then?'</p>

<p>The momentary softening had vanished out of Geoffrey Stonor's
face. In its stead the look of aloofness that few dared brave, the
warning 'thus far and no farther' stamped on every feature, he
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>'You can hardly expect me to enter into&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She broke through the barrier without ruth&mdash;such strength,
such courage has honest pain.</p>

<p>'You mean she went away from you?'</p>

<p>'Yes!' The sharp monosyllable fell out like a thing metallic.</p>

<p>'Was that because you wouldn't marry her?'</p>

<p>'I couldn't marry her&mdash;and she knew it.' He turned on his
heel.</p>

<p>'Did you want to?'</p>

<p>He paused nearly at the window, and looked back at her. She
deserved to have the bare 'yes,' but she was a child. He would
soften a little the truth's harsh impact upon the young creature's
shrinking jealousy.</p>

<p>'I thought I wanted to marry her then. It's a long time
ago.'</p>

<p>'And why couldn't you?'</p>

<p>He controlled a movement of strong irritation. 'Why are you
catechizing me? It's a matter that concerns another woman.'</p>

<p>'If you say it doesn't concern me, you're saying'&mdash;her lip
trembled&mdash;'saying that you don't concern me.'</p>

<p>With more difficulty than the girl dreamed, he compelled himself
to answer quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>'In those days&mdash;I&mdash;I was absolutely dependent on my
father.'</p>

<p>'Why, you must have been thirty, Geoffrey.'</p>

<p>'What? Oh&mdash;thereabouts.'</p>

<p>'And everybody says you're so clever.'</p>

<p>'Well, everybody's mistaken.'</p>

<p>She left the table, and drew nearer to him. 'It must have been
terribly hard&mdash;&mdash;'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Sounding the depth of sympathy in the gentle voice, he turned
towards her to meet a check in the phrase&mdash;</p>

<p>'&mdash;&mdash;terribly hard for you both.'</p>

<p>He stood there stonily, but looking rather handsome in his big,
sulky way. The sort of person who dictates terms rather than one
to accept meekly the thing that might befall.</p>

<p>Something of that overbearing look of his must have penetrated
the clouded consciousness of the girl, for she was saying&mdash;</p>

<p>'You! a man like <i>you</i> not to have had the freedom, that even the
lowest seem to have&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Freedom?'</p>

<p>'To marry the woman they choose.'</p>

<p>'She didn't break off our relations because I couldn't marry
her.'</p>

<p>'Why was it, then?'</p>

<p>'You're too young to discuss such a story.' He turned away.</p>

<p>'I'm not so young,' said the shaking voice, 'as she was when&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Very well, then, if you will have it!' His look was ill to meet,
for any one who loved him. 'The truth is, it didn't weigh upon
her as it seems to on you, that I wasn't able to marry her.'</p>

<p>'Why are you so sure of that?'</p>

<p>'Because she didn't so much as hint at it when she wrote that
she meant to break off the&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What made her write like that?'</p>

<p>'Why <i>will</i> you go on talking of what's so long over and
ended?'</p>

<p>'What reason did she give?'</p>

<p>'If your curiosity has so got the upper hand, <i>ask her</i>.'</p>

<p>Her eyes were upon him. In a whisper, 'You're afraid to tell
me,' she said.</p>

<p>He went over to the window, seeming to wait there for something
that did not come. He turned round at last.</p>

<p>'I still hoped, at <i>that</i> time, to win my father over. She blamed
me because'&mdash;again he faced the window and looked blindly
out&mdash;'if the child had lived it wouldn't have been possible to get
my father to&mdash;to overlook it.'</p>

<p>'You&mdash;wanted&mdash;it <i>overlooked</i>?' the girl said faintly. 'I don't
underst&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He came back to her on a wave of passion. 'Of course you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>don't understand. If you did you wouldn't be the beautiful, tender,
innocent child you are.' He took her hand, and tried to draw
her to him.</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand, and shrank from him with a movement,
slight as it was, so tragically eloquent, that fear for the first time
caught hold of him.</p>

<p>'I am glad you didn't mean to desert her, Geoffrey. It wasn't
your fault, after all&mdash;only some misunderstanding that can be
cleared up.'</p>

<p>'<i>Cleared up?</i>'</p>

<p>'Yes, cleared up.'</p>

<p>'You aren't thinking that this miserable old affair I'd as good
as forgotten&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He did not see the horror-struck glance at the door, but he heard
the whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Forgotten!</i>'</p>

<p>'No, no'&mdash;he caught himself up&mdash;'I don't mean exactly forgotten.
But you're torturing me so that I don't know what I'm
saying.' He went closer. 'You aren't going to let this old thing
come between you and me?'</p>

<p>She pressed her handkerchief to her lips, and then took it away.</p>

<p>'I can't make or unmake the past,' she said steadily. 'But
I'm glad, at least, that you didn't mean to desert her in her trouble.
You'll remind her of that first of all, won't you?'</p>

<p>She was moving across the room as she spoke, and, when she
had ended, the handkerchief went quickly to her lips again as if
to shut the door on sobbing.</p>

<p>'Where are you going?' He raised his voice. 'Why should
I remind <i>any</i>body of what I want only to forget?'</p>

<p>'Hush! Oh, hush!' A moment she looked back, holding up
praying hands.</p>

<p>His eyes had flown to the door. 'You don't mean <i>she's</i>&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes. I left her to get a little rest.'</p>

<p>He recoiled in an access of uncontrollable anger. She followed
him. Speechless, he eluded her, and went for his hat.</p>

<p>'Geoffrey,' she cried, 'don't go before you hear me. I don't
know if what I think matters to you now, but I hope it does. You
can still'&mdash;her voice was faint with tears&mdash;'still make me think
of you without shrinking&mdash;if you will.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>He fixed her for a moment with eyes more stern than she had
ever seen.</p>

<p>'What is it you are asking of me?' he said.</p>

<p>'To make amends, Geoffrey.'</p>

<p>His anger went out on a wave of pity. 'You poor little innocent!'</p>

<p>'I'm poor enough. But'&mdash;she locked her hands together like
one who summons all her resolution&mdash;'I'm not so innocent but
what I know you must right that old wrong now, if you're ever to
right it.'</p>

<p>'You aren't insane enough to think I would turn round in these
few hours and go back to something that ten years ago was ended
forever!' As he saw how unmoved her face was, 'Why,' he burst
out, 'it's stark, staring madness!'</p>

<p>'No!' She caught his arm. 'What you did ten years ago&mdash;that
was mad. This is paying a debt.'</p>

<p>Any man looking on, or hearing of Stonor's dilemma, would
have said, 'Leave the girl alone to come to her senses.' But only
a stupid man would himself have done it. Stonor caught her two
hands in his, and drew her into his arms.</p>

<p>'Look, here, Jeannie, you're dreadfully wrought up and excited&mdash;tired,
too.'</p>

<p>'No!' She freed herself, and averted the tear-stained face.
'Not tired, though I've travelled far to-day. I know you smile
at sudden conversions. You think they're hysterical&mdash;worse&mdash;vulgar.
But people must get their revelation how they can. And,
Geoffrey, if I can't make you see this one of mine, I shall know your
love could never mean strength to me&mdash;only weakness. And I
shall be afraid,' she whispered. Her dilated eyes might have seen
a ghost lurking there in the commonplace room. 'So afraid I
should never dare give you the chance of making me loathe myself.'
There was a pause, and out of the silence fell words that were like
the taking of a vow. 'I would never see you again.'</p>

<p>'How right I was to be afraid of that vein of fanaticism in you!'</p>

<p>'Certainly you couldn't make a greater mistake than to go away
now and think it any good ever to come back. Even if I came to
feel different, I couldn't <i>do</i> anything different. I should <i>know</i> all
this couldn't be forgotten. I should know that it would poison
my life in the end&mdash;yours too.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>'She has made good use of her time!' he said bitterly. Then,
upon a sudden thought, 'What has changed <i>her</i>? Has she been
seeing visions too?'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Why is she intriguing to get hold of a man that ten years ago
she flatly refused to see or hold any communication with?'</p>

<p>'Intriguing to get hold of? She hasn't mentioned you!'</p>

<p>'What! Then how, in the name of Heaven, do you know&mdash;she
wants&mdash;what you ask?'</p>

<p>'There can't be any doubt about that,' said the girl, firmly.</p>

<p>With all his tenderness for her, so little still did he understand
what she was going through, that he plainly thought all her pain
had come of knowing that this other page was in his life&mdash;he had
no glimpse of the girl's passionate need to think of that same long-turned-over
page as unmarred by the darker blot.</p>

<p>'You absurd, ridiculous child!' With immense relief he
dropped into the nearest chair. 'Then all this is just your own
unaided invention. Well, I could thank God!' He passed his
handkerchief over his face.</p>

<p>'For what are you thanking God?'</p>

<p>He sat there obviously thinking out his plan of action.</p>

<p>'Suppose&mdash;I'm not going to risk it&mdash;but <i>suppose</i>&mdash;&mdash;' He
looked up, and at the sight of Jean's face he rose with an expression
strangely gentle. The rather hard eyes were softened in a
sudden mist. 'Whether <i>I</i> deserve to suffer or not, it's quite certain
<i>you</i> don't. Don't cry, dear one. It never was the real thing.
I had to wait till I knew you before I understood.'</p>

<p>Her own eyes were brimming as she lifted them in a passion of
gratitude to his face.</p>

<p>'Oh! is that true? Loving you has made things clear to me
I didn't dream of before. If I could think that because of me
you were able to do this&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You go back to that?' He seized her by the shoulders, and
said hoarsely, 'Look here! Do you seriously ask me to give up the
girl I love&mdash;to go and offer to marry a woman that even to think
of&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You cared for her once!' she cried. 'You'll care about her
again. She is beautiful and brilliant&mdash;<i>every</i>thing. I've heard
she could win any man&mdash;&mdash;'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>He pushed the girl from him. 'She's bewitched you!' He was
halfway to the door.</p>

<p>'Geoffrey, Geoffrey, you aren't going away like that? This
isn't <i>the end</i>?'</p>

<p>The face he turned back upon her was dark and hesitating.
'I suppose if she refused me, you'd&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'She won't refuse you.'</p>

<p>'She did once.'</p>

<p>'She didn't refuse to marry you.'</p>

<p>As she passed him on the way to her sitting-room he caught her
by the arm.</p>

<p>'Stop!' he said, glancing about like one hunting desperately
for a means of gaining a few minutes. 'Lady John is waiting all
this time at my house for the car to go back with a message.'</p>

<p>'<i>That's</i> not a matter of life and death!' she said, with all the
impatience of the young at that tyranny of little things which seems
to hold its unrelenting sway, though the battlements of righteousness
are rocking, and the tall towers of love are shaken to the
nethermost foundation-stones.</p>

<p>'No, it's not a matter of life and death,' Stonor said quietly.
'All the same, I'll go down and give the order.'</p>

<p>'Very well.' Of her own accord this time she stopped on her
way to that other door, behind which was the Past and the Future
incarnate in one woman. 'I'll wait,' said Jean. She went to
the table. Sitting there with her face turned from him, she said,
quite low, 'You'll come back, if you're the man I pray you are.'</p>

<p>Her self-control seemed all at once to fail. She leaned her
elbows on the table and broke into a flood of silent tears, with face
hidden in her hands.</p>

<p>He came swiftly back, and bent over her a moved, adoring face.</p>

<p>'Dearest of all the world,' he began, in that beautiful voice of his.</p>

<p>His arms were closing round her, when the door on the left was
softly opened. Vida Levering stood on the threshold.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p>She drew back as soon as she saw him, but Stonor had looked
round. His face darkened as he stood there an instant, silently
challenging her. Not a word spoken by either of them, no sound
but the faint, muffled sobbing of the girl, who sat with hidden face.
With a look of speechless anger, the man went out and shut the
doors behind him. Not seeing, only hearing that he had gone,
Jean threw her arms out across the table in an abandonment of
grief. The other woman laid on a chair the hat and cloak that she
was carrying. Then she went slowly across the room and stood
silent a moment at Jean's side.</p>

<p>'What is the matter?'</p>

<p>The girl started. Impossible for her to speak in that first moment.
But when she had dried her eyes, she said, with a pathetic
childish air&mdash;</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I've been seeing Geoffrey.'</p>

<p>'Is this the effect "seeing Geoffrey" has?' said the other, with
an attempt at lightness.</p>

<p>'You see, I know now,' Jean explained, with the brave directness
that was characteristic.</p>

<p>The more sophisticated woman presented an aspect totally unenlightened.</p>

<p>'I know how he'&mdash;Jean dropped her eyes&mdash;'how he spoiled
some one else's life.'</p>

<p>'Who tells you that?' asked Miss Levering.</p>

<p>'Several people have told me.'</p>

<p>'Well, you should be very careful how you believe what you
hear.'</p>

<p>'You know it's true!' said the girl, passionately.</p>

<p>'I know that it's possible to be mistaken.'</p>

<p>'I see! You're trying to shield him&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why should I? What is it to me?'</p>

<p>'Oh-h, how you must love him!' she said with tears.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>'I? Listen to me,' said Vida, gravely. As she drew up a chair
the girl rose to her feet.</p>

<p>'What's the use&mdash;what's the use of your going on denying it?'
As she saw Vida was about to break in, she silenced her with two
words, '<i>Geoffrey doesn't.</i>' And with that she fled away to the
window.</p>

<p>Vida half rose, and then relinquished the idea of following the
girl, seemed presently to forget her, and sat as one alone with sorrow.
When Jean had mastered herself, she came slowly back.
Not till she was close to the motionless figure did the girl lift her
eyes.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't look like that,' the girl prayed. 'I shall bring him
back to you.'</p>

<p>She was on her knees by Vida's chair. The fixed abstraction
went out of the older face, but it was very cold as she began&mdash;</p>

<p>'You would be impertinent&mdash;if&mdash;you weren't a romantic
child. You can't bring him back.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, he&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No. But'&mdash;Vida looked deep into the candid eyes&mdash;'there
is something you <i>can</i> do&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'Bring him to a point where he recognizes that he is in our debt.'</p>

<p>'In <i>our</i> debt?'</p>

<p>Vida nodded. 'In debt to Women. He can't repay the one he
robbed.'</p>

<p>Jean winced at that. The young do not know that nothing but
money can ever be paid back.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she insisted, out of the faith she still had in him, ready to
be his surety. 'Yes, he can. He will.'</p>

<p>The other shook her head. 'No, he can't repay the dead. But
there are the living. There are the thousands with hope still in
their hearts and youth in their blood. Let him help <i>them</i>. Let
him be a Friend to Women.'</p>

<p>'I understand!' Jean rose up, wide-eyed. 'Yes, <i>that</i> too.'</p>

<p>The door had opened, and Lady John was coming in with Stonor
towering beside her. When he saw the girl rising from her knees,
he turned to Lady John with a little gesture of, 'What did I tell
you?'</p>

<p>The moment Jean caught sight of him, 'Thank you!' she said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>while her aunt was briskly advancing, filling all the room with a
pleasant silken rustling, and a something nameless, that was like
clear noonday after storm-cloud or haunted twilight.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said in a cheerful commonplace tone to Jean; 'you
rather gave us the slip! Vida, I believe Mr. Stonor wants to see
you for a few minutes, but'&mdash;she glanced at her watch&mdash;'I'd
like a word with you first, as I must get back. Do you think the
car'&mdash;she turned to Stonor&mdash;'your man said something about
recharging&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, did he? I'll see about it.' As he went out he brushed
past the butler.</p>

<p>'Mr. Trent has called, miss, to take the lady to the meeting,'
said that functionary.</p>

<p>'Bring Mr. Trent into my sitting-room,' said Jean hastily,
and then to Miss Levering, 'I'll tell him you can't go to-night.'</p>

<p>Lady John stood watching the girl with critical eyes till she
had disappeared into the adjoining room and shut the door behind
her. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>'I know, my dear'&mdash;she spoke almost apologetically&mdash;'you're
not aware of what that impulsive child wants to insist on. I feel
it an embarrassment even to tell you.'</p>

<p>'I know.'</p>

<p>'You know?' Lady John waited for condemnation of Jean's
idea. She waited in vain. 'It isn't with your sanction, surely,
that she makes this extraordinary demand?'</p>

<p>'I didn't sanction it at first,' said the other slowly; 'but I've
been thinking it over.'</p>

<p>Lady John's suavity stiffened perceptibly. 'Then all I can say
is, I am greatly disappointed in you. You threw this man over
years ago, for reasons, whatever they were, that seemed to you
good and sufficient. And now you come in between him and a
younger woman, just to play Nemesis, so far as I can make out.'</p>

<p>'Is that what he says?'</p>

<p>'He says nothing that isn't fair and considerate.'</p>

<p>'I can see he's changed.'</p>

<p>'And you're unchanged&mdash;is that it?'</p>

<p>'I'm changed even more than he.'</p>

<p>Lady John sat down, with pity and annoyance struggling for the
mastery.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>'You care about him still?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'No? And yet you&mdash;I see! There are obviously certain things
he can give his wife, and you naturally want to marry somebody.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Lady John,' said Vida, wearily, 'there are no men listening.'</p>

<p>'No'&mdash;she looked round surprised&mdash;'I didn't suppose there
were.'</p>

<p>'Then why keep up that old pretence?'</p>

<p>'What pret&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That to marry <i>at all costs</i> is every woman's dearest ambition
till the grave closes over her. You and I <i>know</i> it isn't true.'</p>

<p>'Well, but&mdash;&mdash;' Her ladyship blinked, suddenly seeing daylight.
'Oh! It was just the unexpected sight of him bringing it
all back! <i>That</i> was what fired you this afternoon. Of course'&mdash;she
made an honest attempt at sympathetic understanding&mdash;'the
memory of a thing like that can never die&mdash;can never even be
dimmed for the woman.'</p>

<p>'I mean her to think so.'</p>

<p>'Jean?'</p>

<p>Vida nodded.</p>

<p>'But it isn't so?'</p>

<p>Lady John was a little bewildered.</p>

<p>'You don't seriously believe,' said Vida, 'that a woman, with
anything else to think about, comes to the end of ten years still
absorbed in a memory of that sort?'</p>

<p>Lady John stared speechless a moment. 'You've got over it,
then?'</p>

<p>'If it weren't for the papers, I shouldn't remember twice a
year there was ever such a person as Geoffrey Stonor in the
world.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm <i>so</i> glad!' said Lady John, with unconscious rapture.</p>

<p>Vida smiled grimly. 'Yes, I'm glad, too.'</p>

<p>'And if Geoffrey Stonor offered you&mdash;er&mdash;"reparation,"
you'd refuse it?'</p>

<p>'Geoffrey Stonor! For me he's simply one of the far back links
in a chain of evidence. It's certain I think a hundred times of
other women's present unhappiness to once that I remember that
old unhappiness of mine that's past. I think of the nail and chain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>makers of Cradley Heath, the sweated girls of the slums; I think,'
her voice fell, 'of the army of ill-used women, whose very existence
I mustn't mention&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Lady John interrupted her hurriedly. 'Then why in heaven's
name do you let poor Jean imagine&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Vida suddenly bent forward. 'Look&mdash;I'll trust you, Lady
John. I don't suffer from that old wrong as Jean thinks I do,
but I shall coin her sympathy into gold for a greater cause than
mine.'</p>

<p>'I don't understand you.'</p>

<p>'Jean isn't old enough to be able to care as much about a principle
as about a person. But if my old half-forgotten pain can
turn her generosity into the common treasury&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What do you propose she shall do, poor child?'</p>

<p>'Use her hold over Geoffrey Stonor to make him help us.'</p>

<p>'To help you?'</p>

<p>'The man who served one woman&mdash;God knows how many
more&mdash;very ill, shall serve hundreds of thousands well. Geoffrey
Stonor shall make it harder for his son, harder still for his grandson,
to treat any woman as he treated me.'</p>

<p>'How will he do that?' said the lady coldly.</p>

<p>'By putting an end to the helplessness of women.'</p>

<p>'You must think he has a great deal of power,' said her ladyship,
with some irony.</p>

<p>'Power? Yes,' answered the other, 'men have too much over
penniless and frightened women.'</p>

<p>'What nonsense! You talk as though the women hadn't their
share of human nature. <i>We</i> aren't made of ice any more than the
men.'</p>

<p>'No, but we have more self-control.'</p>

<p>'Than men?'</p>

<p>Vida had risen. She looked down at her friend. 'You know
we have,' she said.</p>

<p>'I know,' said Lady John shrewdly, 'we mustn't admit it.'</p>

<p>'For fear they'd call us fishes?'</p>

<p>Lady John had been frankly shocked at the previous plain
speaking, but she found herself stimulated to show in this moment
of privacy that even she had not travelled her sheltered way through
the world altogether in blinkers.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>'They talk of our lack of self-control, but,' she admitted, 'it's
the last thing men <i>want</i> women to have.'</p>

<p>'Oh, we know what they want us to have! So we make shift
to have it. If we don't, we go without hope&mdash;sometimes we go
without bread.'</p>

<p>'Vida! Do you mean to say that you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I mean to say that men's vanity won't let them see it, but the
thing's largely a question of economics.'</p>

<p>'You <i>never</i> loved him, then!'</p>

<p>'Yes, I loved him&mdash;once. It was my helplessness that turned
the best thing life can bring into a curse for both of us.'</p>

<p>'I don't understand you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, being "understood"! that's too much to expect. I
make myself no illusions. When people come to know that I've
joined the Women's Union&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But you won't'</p>

<p>'&mdash;&mdash;who is there who will resist the temptation to say "Poor
Vida Levering! What a pity she hasn't got a husband and a baby
to keep her quiet"? The few who know about me, they'll be
equally sure that, not the larger view of life I've gained, but my
own poor little story, is responsible for my new departure.' She
leaned forward and looked into Lady John's face. 'My best
friend, she will be surest of all, that it's a private sense of loss, or
lower yet, a grudge, that's responsible for my attitude. I tell
you the only difference between me and thousands of women with
husbands and babies is that I am free to say what I think. <i>They
aren't!</i>'</p>

<p>Lady John opened her lips and then closed them firmly. After
all, why pursue the matter? She had got the information she had
come for.</p>

<p>'I must hurry back;' she rose, murmuring, 'my poor ill-used
guests&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Vida stood there quiet, a little cold. 'I won't ring,' she said.
'I think you'll find Mr. Stonor downstairs waiting for you.'</p>

<p>'Oh&mdash;a&mdash;he will have left word about the car in any case.'</p>

<p>Lady John's embarrassment was not so much at seeing that her
friend had divined the gist of the arrangement that had been effected
downstairs. It was that Vida should be at no pains to throw
a decent veil over the fact of her realization that Lady John had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>come there in the character of scout. With an openness not wholly
free from scorn, the younger woman had laid her own cards on the
table. She made no scruple at turning her back on Lady John's
somewhat incoherent evasion. Ignoring it she crossed the room
and opened the door for her.</p>

<p>Jean was in the corridor saying good-bye to the chairman of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>'Well, Mr. Trent,' said Miss Levering in even tones, 'I didn't
expect to see you this evening.'</p>

<p>He came forward and stood in the doorway. 'Why not? Have
I ever failed?'</p>

<p>'Lady John,' said Vida, turning, 'this is one of our allies. He
is good enough to squire me through the rabble from time to
time.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Lady John, advancing quite graciously, 'I think it's
very handsome of you after what she said to-day about men.'</p>

<p>'I've no great opinion of most men myself,' said the young gentleman.
'I might add, or of most women.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' Lady John laughed. 'At any rate I shall go away relieved
to think that Miss Levering's plain speaking hasn't alienated
<i>all</i> masculine regard.'</p>

<p>'Why should it?' he said.</p>

<p>'That's right.' Lady John metaphorically patted him on the
back. 'Don't believe all she says in the heat of propaganda.'</p>

<p>'I <i>do</i> believe all she says. But I'm not cast down.'</p>

<p>'Not when she says&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Was there never,' he made bold to interrupt, 'a misogynist of
<i>my</i> sex who ended by deciding to make an exception?'</p>

<p>'Oh!' Lady John smiled significantly; 'if <i>that's</i> what you
build on!'</p>

<p>'Why,' he demanded with an effort to convey 'pure logic,'
'why shouldn't a man-hater on your side prove equally open to
reason?'</p>

<p>'That aspect of the question has become irrelevant so far as
I'm personally concerned,' said Vida, exasperated by Lady John's
look of pleased significance. 'I've got to a place where I realize
that the first battles of this new campaign must be fought by women
alone. The only effective help men could give&mdash;amendment of
the law&mdash;they refuse. The rest is nothing.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>'Don't be ungrateful, Vida. Here is this gentleman ready to face
criticism in publicly championing you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, but it's an illusion that I, as an individual, need a champion.
I am quite safe in the crowd. Please don't wait for me and
don't come for me again.'</p>

<p>The sensitive dark face flushed. 'Of course if you'd rather&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And that reminds me,' she went on, unfairly punishing poor Mr.
Trent for Lady John's meaning looks, 'I was asked to thank you,
and to tell you, too, that they won't need your chairmanship any
more&mdash;though that, I beg you to believe, has nothing to do with
any feeling of mine.'</p>

<p>He was hurt and he showed it. 'Of course I know there must
be other men ready&mdash;better known men&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It isn't that. It's simply that we find a man can't keep a rowdy
meeting in order as well as a woman.'</p>

<p>He stared.</p>

<p>'You aren't serious?' said Lady John.</p>

<p>'Haven't you noticed,' Miss Levering put it to Trent, 'that all
our worst disturbances come when men are in charge?'</p>

<p>'Ha! ha! Well&mdash;a&mdash;I hadn't connected the two ideas.'</p>

<p>Still laughing a little ruefully, he suffered himself to be taken
downstairs by kind little Miss Dunbarton, who had stood without
a word waiting there with absent face.</p>

<p>'That nice boy's in love with you,' said Lady John, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>Vida looked at her without answering.</p>

<p>'Good-bye.' They shook hands. 'I <i>wish</i> you hadn't been so
unkind to that nice boy.'</p>

<p>'Do you?'</p>

<p>'Yes; for then I would be more sure of your telling Geoffrey
Stonor that intelligent women don't nurse their wrongs indefinitely,
and lie in wait to punish them.'</p>

<p>'You are <i>not</i> sure?'</p>

<p>Lady John went up close and looked into her face with searching
anxiety. 'Are <i>you</i>?' she asked.</p>

<p>Vida stood there mute, with eyes on the ground. Lady John
glanced nervously at her watch, and, with a gesture of perturbation,
hurriedly left the room. The other went slowly back to her
place by the table.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>The look she bent on Stonor as he came in seemed to take
no <a name="Page_292t" id="Page_292t"></a><a href="#Page_292tn">account</a> of those hurried glimpses at the Tunbridges' months
before, and twice to-day when other eyes were watching. It was
as if now, for the first time since they parted, he stood forth clearly.
This man with the changed face, coming in at the door and carefully
shutting it&mdash;he had once been Mystery's high priest and had
held the keys of Joy. To-day, beyond a faint pallor, there was
no trace of emotion in that face that was the same and yet so different.
Not even anger there. Where a less complex man would
have brought in, if not the menace of a storm, at least an intimation
of masterfulness that should advertise the uselessness of
opposition, Stonor brought a subtler ally in what, for lack of better
words, must be called an air of heightened fastidiousness&mdash;mainly
physical. Man has no shrewder weapon against the woman he has
loved and wishes to exorcise from his path. For the simple,
and even for those not so much simple as merely sensitive, there is
something in that cool, sure assumption of unapproachableness
on the part of one who once had been so near&mdash;something that
lames advance and hypnotizes vision. Geoffrey Stonor's aloofness
was not in the 'high look' alone; it was as much as anything in the
very way he walked, as if the ground were hardly good enough,
in the way he laid his shapely hand on the carved back of the sofa,
the way his eyes rested on inanimate things in the room, reducing
whoever was responsible for them to the need of justifying their
presence and defending their value.</p>

<p>As the woman in the chair, leaning cheek on hand, sat silently
watching him, it may have been that obscure things in those headlong
hours of the past grew plainer.</p>

<p>However ludicrous the result may look in the last analysis, it is
clear that a faculty such as Stonor's for overrating the value of the
individual in the scheme of things, does seem more effectually
than any mere patent of nobility to confer upon a man the 'divine
right' to dictate to his fellows and to look down upon them. The
thing is founded on illusion, but it is founded as firm as many another
figment that has governed men and seen the generations come
to heel and go crouching to their graves.</p>

<p>But the shining superiority of the man seemed to be a little
dimmed for the woman sitting there. The old face and the new
face, she saw them both through a cloud of long-past memories
and a mist of present tears.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well, have they primed you?' she said very low. 'Have you
got your lesson&mdash;by heart at last?'</p>

<p>He looked at her from immeasurable distance. 'I am not sure
that I understand you,' he said. He waited an instant, then, seeing
no explanation vouchsafed, 'However unpropitious your mood
may be,' he went on with a satirical edge in his tone, 'I shall discharge
my errand.'</p>

<p>Still she waited.</p>

<p>Her silence seemed to irritate him. 'I have promised,' he
said, with a formality that smacked of insolence, 'to offer you what
I believe is called "amends."'</p>

<p>The quick change in the brooding look should have warned
him.</p>

<p>'You have come to realize, then&mdash;after all these years&mdash;that
you owed me something?'</p>

<p>He checked himself on the brink of protest. 'I am not here to
deny it.'</p>

<p>'Pay, then,' she said fiercely&mdash;'pay.'</p>

<p>A moment's dread flickered in his eye and then was gone. 'I
have said that, if you exact it, I will.'</p>

<p>'Ah! If I insist, you'll "make it all good"! Then, don't
you know, you must pay me in kind?'</p>

<p>He looked down upon her&mdash;a long, long way. 'What do you
mean?'</p>

<p>'Give me back what you took from me&mdash;my old faith,' she said,
with shaking voice. 'Give me that.'</p>

<p>'Oh, if you mean to make phrases&mdash;&mdash;' He half turned
away, but the swift words overtook him.</p>

<p>'Or, give me back mere kindness&mdash;or even tolerance! Oh,
I don't mean <i>your</i> tolerance.' She was on her feet to meet his
eyes as he faced her again. 'Give me back the power to think
fairly of my brothers&mdash;not as mockers&mdash;thieves.'</p>

<p>'I have not mocked you. And I have asked you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Something you knew I should refuse. Or'&mdash;her eyes blazed&mdash;'or
did you dare to be afraid I wouldn't?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I suppose'&mdash;he buttressed his good faith with bitterness&mdash;'I
suppose if we set our teeth we could&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I couldn't&mdash;not even if I set my teeth. And you wouldn't
dream of asking me if you thought there was the smallest chance.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>Ever so faintly he raised his heavy shoulders. 'I can do no
more than make you an offer of such reparation as is in my power.
If you don't accept it&mdash;&mdash;' He turned away with an air of '<i>that's</i>
done.'</p>

<p>But her emotion had swept her out of her course. She found
herself at his side.</p>

<p>'Accept it? No! Go away and live in debt. Pay and pay and
pay&mdash;and find yourself still in debt&mdash;for a thing you'll never
be able to give me back. And when you come to die'&mdash;her voice
fell&mdash;'say to yourself, "I paid all my creditors but one."'</p>

<p>He stopped on his way to the door and faced her again. 'I'm
rather tired, you know, of this talk of debt. If I hear that you
persist in it, I shall have to&mdash;&mdash;' Again he checked himself.</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'No. I'll keep to my resolution.'</p>

<p>He had nearly reached the threshold. She saw what she had
lost by her momentary lack of that boasted self-control. She
forestalled him at the door.</p>

<p>'What resolution?' she asked.</p>

<p>He looked down at her an instant, clothed from head to foot in
that indefinable armour of unapproachableness. This was a man
who asked other people questions, himself ill-accustomed to be
catechised. If he replied it was a grace.</p>

<p>'I came here,' he said, 'under considerable pressure, to speak
of the future. Not to reopen the past.'</p>

<p>'The future and the past are one,' said the woman at the door.</p>

<p>'You talk as if that old madness was mine alone; it is the
woman's way.'</p>

<p>'I know,' she agreed, to his obvious surprise, 'and it's not fair.
Men suffer as well as we by the woman's starting wrong. We are
taught to think the man a sort of demi-god. If he tells her, "Go
down into hell," down into hell she goes.'</p>

<p>He would not have been human had he not resented that harsh
summary of those days that lay behind.</p>

<p>'Make no mistake,' he said. 'Not the woman alone. <i>They
go down together.</i>'</p>

<p>'Yes, they go down together. But the man comes up alone.
As a rule. It is more convenient so&mdash;<i>for him</i>. And even for
the other woman.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Both pairs of eyes went to Jean's door.</p>

<p>'My conscience is clear,' he said angrily. 'I know&mdash;and so do
you&mdash;that most men in my position wouldn't have troubled themselves.
I gave myself endless trouble.'</p>

<p>She looked at him with wondering eyes. 'So you've gone about
all these years feeling that you'd discharged every obligation?'</p>

<p>'Not only that. I stood by you with a fidelity that was nothing
short of Quixotic. If, woman-like, you <i>must</i> recall the past, I
insist on your recalling it correctly.'</p>

<p>'You think I don't recall it correctly?' she said very low.</p>

<p>'Not when you make&mdash;other people believe that I deserted
you!' The gathering volume of his righteous wrath swept the
cool precision out of his voice. 'It's a curious enough charge,'
he said, 'when you stop to consider&mdash;&mdash;' Again he checked himself,
and, with a gesture of impatience, was for sweeping the whole
thing out of his way, including that figure at the door.</p>

<p>But she stood there. 'Well, when we do just for five minutes
out of ten years&mdash;when we do stop to consider&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We remember it was <i>you</i> who did the deserting. And since
you had to rake the story up, you might have had the fairness to
tell the facts.'</p>

<p>'You think "the facts" would have excused you?'</p>

<p>It was a new view. She left the door, and sat down in the nearest
chair.</p>

<p>'No doubt you've forgotten the facts, since Lady John tells me
you wouldn't remember my existence once a year, if the papers
didn't&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah!' she interrupted, with a sorry little smile, 'you minded
that!'</p>

<p>'I mind your giving false impressions,' he said with spirit. As
she was about to speak he advanced upon her. 'Do you deny'&mdash;he
bent over her, and told off those three words by striking one
clenched fist into the palm of the other hand&mdash;'do you deny that
you returned my letters unopened?'</p>

<p>'No,' she said.</p>

<p>'Do you deny that you refused to see me, and that when I persisted
you vanished?'</p>

<p>'I don't deny any of those things.'</p>

<p>'Why'&mdash;he stood up straight again, and his shoulders grew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>more square with justification&mdash;'why I had no trace of you for
years.'</p>

<p>'I suppose not.'</p>

<p>'Very well, then.' He walked away. 'What could I do?'</p>

<p>'Nothing. It was too late to do anything.'</p>

<p>'It wasn't too late! You knew, since you "read the papers,"
that my father died that same year. There was no longer any
barrier between us.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, there was a barrier.'</p>

<p>'Of your own making, then.'</p>

<p>'I had my guilty share in it, but the barrier'&mdash;her voice trembled
on the word&mdash;'the barrier was your invention.'</p>

<p>'The only barrier I knew of was no "invention." If you had
ever known my father&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, the echoes! the echoes!' She lay back in the chair.
'How often you used to say, if I "knew your father." But you
said, too'&mdash;her voice sank&mdash;'you called the greatest "barrier"
by another name.'</p>

<p>'What name?'</p>

<p>So low that even he could hardly hear she answered, 'The child
that was to come.'</p>

<p>'That was before my father died,' Stonor returned hastily,
'while I still hoped to get his consent.'</p>

<p>She nodded, and her eyes were set like wide doors for memory
to enter in.</p>

<p>'How the thought of that all-powerful personage used to terrorize
me! What chance had a little unborn child against "the
last of the great feudal lords," as you called him?'</p>

<p>'You <i>know</i> the child would have stood between you and me.'</p>

<p>'I know the child did stand between you and me.'</p>

<p>He stared at her. With vague uneasiness he repeated, '<i>Did</i>
stand&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She seemed not to hear. The tears were running down her rigid
face.</p>

<p>'Happy mothers teach their children. Mine had to teach
me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You talk as if&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'&mdash;&mdash;teach me that a woman may do that for love's sake that
shall kill love.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither spoke for some seconds. Fearing and putting from
him fuller comprehension, he broke the silence, saying with an air
of finality&mdash;</p>

<p>'You certainly made it plain you had no love left for me.'</p>

<p>'I had need of it all for the child.' Her voice had a curious
crooning note in it.</p>

<p>He came closer. He bent down to put the low question, 'Do
you mean, then, that after all&mdash;it lived?'</p>

<p>'No. I mean that it was sacrificed. But it showed me no barrier
is so impassable as the one a little child can raise.'</p>

<p>It was as if lightning had flashed across the old picture. He
drew back from the fierce illumination.</p>

<p>'Was <i>that</i> why you&mdash;&mdash;' he began, in a voice that was almost a
whisper. 'Was that why?'</p>

<p>She nodded, speechless a moment for tears. 'Day and night
there it was between my thought of you and me.'</p>

<p>He sat down, staring at her.</p>

<p>'When I was most unhappy,' she went on, in that low voice, 'I
would wake thinking I heard it cry. It was my own crying I
heard, but I seemed to have it in my arms. I suppose I was mad.
I used to lie there in that lonely farmhouse pretending to hush it.
It was so I hushed myself.'</p>

<p>'I never knew&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I didn't blame you. You couldn't risk being with me.'</p>

<p>'You agreed that, for both our sakes&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, you had to be very circumspect. You were so well known.
Your autocratic father, your brilliant political future&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Be fair. Our future&mdash;as I saw it then.'</p>

<p>'Yes, everything hung on concealment. It must have looked
quite simple to you. You didn't know the ghost of a child that
had never seen the light, the frail thing you meant to sweep aside
and forget'&mdash;she was on her feet&mdash;'<i>have</i> swept aside and forgotten!&mdash;you
didn't know it was strong enough to push you out of
my life.' With an added intensity, 'It can do more!' she said.
She leaned over his bowed figure and whispered, 'It can push that
girl out!' As again she stood erect, half to herself she added, 'It
can do more still.'</p>

<p>'Are you threatening me?' he said dully.</p>

<p>'No, I am preparing you.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>'For what?'</p>

<p>'For the work that must be done. Either with your help or that
girl's.'</p>

<p>The man's eyes lifted a moment.</p>

<p>'One of two things,' she said&mdash;'either her life, and all she has,
given to this new Service; or a ransom if I give her up to you.'</p>

<p>'I see. A price. Well&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>She looked searchingly at him for an instant, and then slowly
shook her head.</p>

<p>'Even if I could trust you to pay the price,' she said, 'I'm not
sure but what a young and ardent soul as faithful and as pure as
hers&mdash;I'm not sure but I should make a poor bargain for my sex
to give that up for anything you could do.'</p>

<p>He found his feet like a man roused out of an evil dream to some
reality darker than the dream. 'In spite of your assumption, she
may not be your tool,' he said.</p>

<p>'You are horribly afraid she is! But you are wrong. She's an
instrument in stronger hands than mine. Soon my little personal
influence over her will be merged in something infinitely greater.
Oh, don't think it's merely I that have got hold of Jean Dunbarton.'</p>

<p>'Who else?'</p>

<p>'The New Spirit that's abroad.'</p>

<p>With an exclamation he turned away. And though his look
branded the idea for a wild absurdity, sentinel-like he began to
pace up and down a few yards from Jean's door.</p>

<p>'How else,' said the woman, 'should that inexperienced girl
have felt the new loyalty and responded as she did?'</p>

<p>'"New," indeed!' he said under his breath, 'however little
"loyal."'</p>

<p>'Loyal, above all. But no newer than electricity was when it
first lit up the world. It had been there since the world began&mdash;waiting
to do away with the dark. <i>So has the thing you're
fighting.</i>'</p>

<p>'The thing I'm fighting'&mdash;and the violence with which he spoke
was only in his face and air; he held his voice down to its lowest
register&mdash;'the thing I'm fighting is nothing more than one person's
hold upon a highly sensitive imagination. I consented to
this interview with the hope'&mdash;he made a gesture of impotence.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>'It only remains for me to show her that your true motive is revenge.'</p>

<p>'Once say that to her, and you are lost.'</p>

<p>He stole an uneasy look at the woman out of a face that had
grown haggard.</p>

<p>'If you were fighting for that girl only against me, you'd
win,' she said. 'It isn't so&mdash;and you will fail. The influence
that has hold of her is in the very air. No soul knows where
it comes from, except that it comes from the higher sources of
civilization.'</p>

<p>'I see the origin of it before my eyes!'</p>

<p>'As little as you see the beginnings of life. This is like the other
mysterious forces of Mother Earth. No warning given&mdash;no
sign. A night wind passes over the brown land, and in the morning
the fields are green.'</p>

<p>His look was the look of one who sees happiness slipping
away. 'Or it passes over gardens like a frost,' he said, 'and the
flowers die.'</p>

<p>'I know that is what men fear. It even seems as if it must be
through fear that your enlightenment will come. The strangest
things make you men afraid! That's why I see a value in Jean
Dunbarton far beyond her fortune.'</p>

<p>He looked at her dully.</p>

<p>'More than any other girl I know&mdash;if I keep her from you, that
gentle, inflexible creature could rouse in men the old half-superstitious
fear&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Fear! Are you mad?'</p>

<p>'Mad!' she echoed. 'Unsexed'&mdash;those are the words to-day.
In the Middle Ages men cried out 'Witch!' and burnt her&mdash;the
woman who served no man's bed or board.</p>

<p>'You want to make the poor child believe&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'She sees for herself we've come to a place where we find there's
a value in women apart from the value men see in them. You teach
us not to look to you for some of the things we need most. If women
must be freed by women, we have need of such as&mdash;&mdash;' Her eyes
went to the door that Stonor still had an air of guarding. 'Who
knows&mdash;she may be the new Joan of Arc.'</p>

<p>He paused, and for that moment he <a name="Page_299t" id="Page_299t"></a><a href="#Page_299tn">seemed</a> as bankrupt in denunciation
as he was in hope. This personal application of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>new heresy found him merely aghast, with no words but 'That
<i>she</i> should be the sacrifice!'</p>

<p>'You have taught us to look very calmly on the sacrifice of
women,' was the ruthless answer. 'Men tell us in every tongue,
it's "a necessary evil."'</p>

<p>He stood still a moment, staring at the ground.</p>

<p>'One girl's happiness&mdash;against a thing nobler than happiness
for thousands&mdash;who can hesitate? <i>Not Jean.</i>'</p>

<p>'Good God! can't you see that this crazed campaign you'd
start her on&mdash;even if it's successful, it can only be so through the
help of men? What excuse shall you make your own soul for
not going straight to the goal?'</p>

<p>'You think we wouldn't be glad,' she said, 'to go straight to the
goal?'</p>

<p>'I do. I see you'd much rather punish me and see her revel in
a morbid self-sacrifice.'</p>

<p>'You say I want to punish you only because, like other men, you
won't take the trouble to understand what we do want&mdash;or how
determined we are to have it. You can't kill this New Spirit
among women.' She went nearer. 'And you couldn't make a
greater mistake than to think it finds a home only in the exceptional
or the unhappy. It is so strange to see a man like you as much
deluded as the Hyde Park loafers, who say to Ernestine Blunt,
"Who's hurt <i>your</i> feelings?" Why not realize'&mdash;she came still
closer, if she had put out her hand she would have touched him&mdash;'this
is a thing that goes deeper than personal experience? And
yet,' she said in a voice so hushed that it was full of a sense of the
girl on the other side of the door, 'if you take only the narrowest
personal view, a good deal depends on what you and I agree upon
in the next five minutes.'</p>

<p>'You recommend my realizing the larger issues. But in your
ambition to attach that poor girl to the chariot-wheels of Progress'&mdash;his
voice put the drag of ironic pomposity upon the phrase&mdash;'you
quite ignore the fact that people fitter for such work, the men
you look to enlist in the end, are ready waiting'&mdash;he pulled himself
up in time for an anti-climax&mdash;'to give the thing a chance.'</p>

<p>'Men are ready! What men?'</p>

<p>His eyes evaded hers. He picked his words. 'Women have
themselves to blame that the question has grown so delicate that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>responsible people shrink for the moment from being implicated
in it.'</p>

<p>'We have seen the shrinking.'</p>

<p>'Without quoting any one else, I might point out that the New
Antagonism seems to have blinded you to the small fact that I for
one am not an opponent.'</p>

<p>'The phrase has a familiar ring. We have heard it four hundred
and twenty times.'</p>

<p>His eyes were shining with anger. 'I spoke, if I may say so, of
some one who would count. Some one who can carry his party
along with him&mdash;or risk a seat in the cabinet over the issue.'</p>

<p>'Did you mean you are "ready" to do that?' she exclaimed.</p>

<p>'An hour ago I was.'</p>

<p>'Ah! an hour ago!'</p>

<p>'Exactly! You don't understand men. They can be led;
they can't be driven. Ten minutes before you came into the room
I was ready to say I would throw in my political lot with this
Reform.'</p>

<p>'And now?'</p>

<p>'Now you block my way by an attempt at coercion. By forcing
my hand you give my adherence an air of bargain-driving for a
personal end. Exactly the mistake of the ignorant agitators in
Trafalgar Square. You have a great deal to learn. This movement
will go forward, not because of the agitation outside, but in
spite of it. There are men in Parliament who would have been
actively serving the Reform to-day&mdash;as actively as so vast a
constitutional change&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She smiled faintly. 'And they haven't done it because&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Because it would have put a premium on breaches of decent
behaviour and defiance of the law!'</p>

<p>She looked at him with an attempt to appear to accept this version.
What did it matter what reasons were given for past failure,
if only the future might be assured? He had taken a piece of
crumpled paper from his pocket and smoothed it out.</p>

<p>'Look here!' He held the telegram before her.</p>

<p>She flushed with excitement as she read. 'This is very good.
I see only one objection.'</p>

<p>'Objection!'</p>

<p>'You haven't sent it.'</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>'That is your fault.' And he looked as if he thought he spoke
the truth.</p>

<p>'When did you write this?'</p>

<p>'Just before you came in&mdash;when she began to talk about&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah, Jean!' Vida gave him back the paper. 'That must have
pleased Jean.'</p>

<p>It was a master stroke, the casual giving back, and the invocation
of a pleasure that had been strangled at the birth along with
something greater. Did he see before him again the girl's tear-filled,
hopeless eyes, that had not so much as read the wonderful
message, too intent upon the death-warrant of their common happiness?
He threw himself heavily into a chair, staring at the closed
door. Behind it, in a prison of which this woman held the key,
Jean waited for her life sentence. Stonor's look, his attitude,
seemed to say that he too only waited now to hear it. He dropped
his head in his hand.</p>

<p>When Vida spoke, it was without raising her eyes from the
ground.</p>

<p>'I could drive a hard-and-fast bargain with you; but I think I
won't. If love and ambition both urge you on, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;'
She looked up a little defiantly, seeming to expect to meet triumph
in his face. Instead, her eye took in the profound hopelessness of
the bent head, the slackness of the big frame, that so suddenly
had assumed a look of age. She went over to him silently, and
stood by his side. 'After all,' she said, 'life hasn't been quite fair
to you.' At the new thing in her voice he raised his heavy eyes.
'You fall out of one ardent woman's dreams into another's,' she said.</p>

<p>'Then you don't&mdash;after all, you don't mean to&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'To keep you and her apart? No.'</p>

<p>For the first time tears came into his eyes.</p>

<p>After a little silence he held out his hand. 'What can I do for
you?'</p>

<p>She seemed not to see the hand he offered. Or did she only see
that it was empty? She was looking at the other. Mere instinct
made him close his left hand more firmly on the message.</p>

<p>It was as if something finer than her slim fingers, the woman's
invisible antenn&aelig;, felt the force that would need be overcome if
trial of strength should be precipitated then. Upon his 'What can
I do?' she shook her head.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>'For the real you,' he said. 'Not the Reformer, or the would-be
politician&mdash;for the woman I so unwillingly hurt.' As she only
turned away, he stood up, detaining her with a hold upon her arm.
'You may not believe it, but now that I understand, there is almost
nothing I wouldn't do to right that old wrong.'</p>

<p>'There's nothing to be done,' she said; and then, shrinking under
that look of almost cheerful benevolence, 'You can never give me
back my child.'</p>

<p>More than at the words, at the anguish in her face, his own had
changed.</p>

<p>'Will that ghost give you no rest?' he said.</p>

<p>'Yes, oh, yes.' She was calm again. 'I see life is nobler than
I knew. There is work to do.'</p>

<p>On her way to the great folding doors, once again he stopped
her.</p>

<p>'Why should you think that it's only you these ten years have
taught something to? Why not give even a man credit for a willingness
to learn something of life, and for being sorry&mdash;profoundly
sorry&mdash;for the pain his instruction has cost others?
You seem to think I've taken it all quite lightly. That's not fair.
All my life, ever since you disappeared, the thought of you has
hurt. I would give anything I possess to know you&mdash;were happy
again.'</p>

<p>'Oh, happiness!'</p>

<p>'Why shouldn't you find it still?'</p>

<p>He said it with a significance that made her stare, and then?&mdash;</p>

<p>'I see! she couldn't help telling you about Allen Trent&mdash;Lady
John couldn't!'</p>

<p>He ignored the interpretation.</p>

<p>'You're one of the people the years have not taken from, but
given more to. You are more than ever&mdash;&mdash;You haven't lost
your beauty.'</p>

<p>'The gods saw it was so little effectual, it wasn't worth taking
away.'</p>

<p>She stood staring out into the void. 'One woman's mishap&mdash;what
is that? A thing as trivial to the great world as it's sordid
in most eyes. But the time has come when a woman may look
about her and say, What general significance has my secret pain?
Does it "join on" to anything? And I find it <i>does</i>. I'm no longer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>simply a woman who has stumbled on the way.' With difficulty
she controlled the shake in her voice. 'I'm one who has got up
bruised and bleeding, wiped the dust from her hands and the tears
from her face&mdash;and said to herself not merely: Here's one luckless
woman! but&mdash;here is a stone of stumbling to many. Let's
see if it can't be moved out of other women's way. And she calls
people to come and help. No mortal man, let alone a woman,
<i>by herself</i>, can move that rock of offence. But,' she ended with a
sudden sombre flare of enthusiasm, 'if <i>many</i> help, Geoffrey, the
thing can be done.'</p>

<p>He looked down on her from his height with a wondering pity.</p>

<p>'Lord! how you care!' he said, while the mist deepened before
his eyes.</p>

<p>'Don't be so sad,' she said&mdash;not seeming to see his sadness was
not for himself. It was as if she could not turn her back on him
this last time without leaving him comforted. 'Shall I tell you a
secret? Jean's ardent dreams needn't frighten you, if she has a
child. <i>That</i>&mdash;from the beginning it was not the strong arm&mdash;it
was the weakest, the little, little arms that subdued the fiercest
of us.'</p>

<p>He held out a shaking hand, so uncertain, that it might have
been begging pity, or it might have been bestowing it. Even then
she did not take it, but a great gentleness was in her face as she
said&mdash;</p>

<p>'You will have other children, Geoffrey; for me there was to
be only one. Well, well,' she brushed the tears away, 'since men
have tried, and failed to make a decent world for the little children
to live in, it's as well some of us are childless. Yes,' she said
quietly, taking up the hat and cloak, '<i>we</i> are the ones who have no
excuse for standing aloof from the fight!'</p>

<p>Her hand was on the door.</p>

<p>'Vida!'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'You forgot something.'</p>

<p>She looked back.</p>

<p>He was signing the message. '<i>This</i>,' he said.</p>

<p>She went out with the paper in her hand.</p>
